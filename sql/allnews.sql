(1, 'LOCAL L.A. Now UCLA law school will use a unique $20-million gift to study Armenian genocide and other atrocities', 'In a unique blend of Hollywood and human rights, the UCLA law school will receive $20 million in pledged proceeds from a new film on the Armenian genocide to expand its research and teaching of persecution, the university announced Monday. The donation by a film company founded by the late Kerkor “Kirk” Kerkorian, an Armenian American philanthropist and businessman, will help establish the Promise Institute for Human Rights at UCLA School of Law. The institute, which also will receive other donations and support from UCLA, will help the Westwood campus expand its research and advocacy on genocide awareness and prevention as well as the intersections between human rights and health, refugees, immigration and civil rights, said law school Dean Jennifer L. Mnookin. She said the gift will help UCLA hire more faculty, sponsor guest speakers, host human rights symposia and support students through fellowships. UCLA law students and faculty currently work with human rights organizations in countries including Bangladesh, Honduras, India and South Africa, and with the United Nations and the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. “What we’d like to become is the West Coast powerhouse for the study and practice of human rights,” Mnookin said.   Todd Cheney/ UCLA Law     (Todd Cheney/ UCLA Law) Eric Esrailian, a UCLA doctor and great-grandson of genocide survivors, helped Kerkorian launch the film company Survival Pictures in 2012, to expand awareness of human rights atrocities. Kerkorian, who owned the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio and is credited with helping develop Las Vegas with such hotels as the MGM Grand, donated more than $1 billion to charitable causes during his lifetime. He died in 2015 at age 98. Survival Pictures’ debut production, “The Promise,” is set to open Friday as the first major film on the Armenian genocide. Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians and other ethnic and religious minorities perished at the hands of the Ottoman Turks beginning in 1915, although the Turkish government denies there was any official policy of ethnic cleansing. The film is directed by Terry George — who directed and co-wrote “Hotel Rwanda” about genocide in that African nation — and stars Christian Bale, Charlotte Le Bon and Oscar Isaac. Co-producers are Esrailian, Phoenix Pictures chairman Mike Medavoy and veteran film producer William Horberg. Esrailian said the team began work on the film in 2010 but kept the project on the down low to avoid any possible political attempts to quash it. The company also has produced a documentary, “Intent to Destroy,” about the Armenian genocide that is set for release April 25 at the Tribeca Film Festival. “As horrible as the Armenian genocide was, there are other ethnic and religious groups that have suffered persecution as well,” Esrailian said, adding that human rights crises exist right now in Syria, the Congo and South Sudan. Both the feature film and the UCLA institute bear the word “promise” to reflect a commitment not to forget atrocities of the past and to fight against intolerance and persecution today, he said. He said his team was inspired by the USC Shoah Foundation, which was launched by filmmaker Steven Spielberg to preserve the memory of the Holocaust and educate the public about it and has since expanded its work to other genocides. With genocide awareness and human rights work underway at the city’s two premier universities, Los Angeles is set to become a national hub of research and activism on the issue, Esrailian said. The center is expected to open this fall.

(2, 'Sports OLYMPICS L.A.''s Olympic bid reportedly draws ''suspicious'' support from unexpected places', 'When the Facebook page for Los Angeles’ 2024 Summer Olympic bid surpassed 1 million “likes” this week, officials issued a news release celebrating the campaign’s “engagement with young people worldwide.” Now a report commissioned by the Associated Press has found a startling percentage of those fans come from far-flung countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Afghanistan. The report, prepared by Socialbakers of the Czech Republic, stated that LA 2024’s likes had grown by more than 700,000 in the last six weeks. "The fan growth evolution for the LA2024 Facebook page does seem suspicious," analyst Michaela Branova was quoted as saying. "Countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan suddenly spike from almost zero to tens of thousands of fans within a few days in February." The sudden increase may have been triggered by the bid committee’s international advertising campaign on the social-media platform. LA 2024 officials, in Denmark to speak at an international sports convention, could not be reached for comment. The private committee has made social media a key element in its campaign, touting its ability to reach a young demographic on not only Facebook but also Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. The Associated Press reported that, while L.A.’s numbers have risen dramatically this year, the rival bid from Paris has also seen a strong uptick in Facebook fans.

(3, 'Sports OLYMPICS Olympic bid contest between L.A. and Paris turns into squabble over social media fans', 'If anyone doubts the race between Los Angeles and Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics is heating up, just look at this week’s dispute over Facebook fans. It began when the LA 2024 contingent announced Monday it had reached 1 million likes on the social media platform. Bid officials celebrated their “engagement with young people worldwide.” The next day, published reports out of Europe cast doubt on the achievement, noting the numbers had risen dramatically in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Afghanistan. Several analysts were quoted as saying the sudden rise looked suspicious and there were allegations the L.A. bid committee had artificially boosted its total. On Wednesday morning, an LA 2024 spokesman fired back, saying the recent uptick in likes had resulted from a standard advertising campaign conducted through Facebook itself. “LA 2024 is a global campaign, as the Olympic movement is global,” Jeff Millman said from Denmark, where bid leaders from both countries are attending a sports convention this week. “There are Olympic stakeholders in every country.” The rise in L.A.’s social media followers over the past two months coincides with the start of the bid cycle’s “international” phase, when candidates are allowed to begin promoting themselves globally. Millman said LA 2024’s Facebook advertising was especially effective in developing countries that aren’t targeted by major brands. Social media experts agreed this strategy can produce quick results. “The research I have done shows that Facebook ads work,” said Gary Wilcox, an advertising professor at the University of Texas. “And most of the organic social media is not working.” Still, there are always concerns about businesses boosting their Facebook status through bots or “like” farms. “Honestly, it’s hard to tell,” said Daniel Mochon, an assistant professor of marketing at Tulane University in New Orleans. “You can purchase fake ‘likes.’” In the quirky realm of Olympic bidding, far-flung countries are actually valuable to L.A. and Paris — International Olympic Committee members from their own nations cannot participate in September’s vote to select a host, but members from places such as Ethiopia and Pakistan can. Look down the International Olympic Committee roster and you’ll see Aruba, Burundi, Liechtenstein, Qatar and St. Lucia on the list. Generating a global buzz could help win critical votes, and both candidate cities have made social media an important element of their campaigns. In France, bid officials recently claimed their #Paris2024 hashtag had reached 328 million impressions. “The growth on our social media numbers shows the immense global interest in Paris’ 2024 bid, and the ability it has to share its story with the world,” chief executive Etienne Thobois said. “Social media brings people together around the world.” david.wharton@latimes.com Follow @LAtimesWharton on Twitter UPDATES: 6:35 p.m.: This article has been updated with new details and quotes.

(4, 'World Myanmar''s long-suffering Rohingya Muslims hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi would make them full citizens. They were wrong', 'It is just an ID card, sky blue and gently creased, but it is Mohammad Siddique’s greatest source of shame. The indignity arises not from its routine details — his name, date of birth, photo, thumbprint — but from what it omits. Unlike documents held by citizens of Myanmar, there is no mention of Siddique’s race or religion. To him it is an identity card that erases his identity. Siddique, 25, is a Rohingya Muslim, a stateless minority of more than 1 million people who live in apartheid-like conditions in the overwhelmingly Buddhist nation of 53 million previously known as Burma. Stripped of their citizenship by the country’s former military rulers, many are effectively trapped in villages and internment camps without the right to travel, work or marry freely within the country where they were born. After a half-century of military rule, human rights activists and Myanmar’s international allies hoped that Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi would loosen the restrictions when her civilian government took office a year ago. But she has refused to restore citizenship to the Rohingya or recognize them as an ethnic group — a sign of the army’s enduring influence as well as the deep antipathy that many Myanmar Buddhists, including leaders of Suu Kyi’s own party, feel toward Muslims. In a limited step, Suu Kyi has adopted a plan to issue the Rohingya ID cards that acknowledge they are residents and start a process to consider their citizenship claims, with no assurances. They just want to kick us out of this country. — Mohammad Siddique, a Rohingya Muslim in Myanmar But many Rohingya oppose the cards, saying the omission of ethnicity is part of a continuing effort to eradicate any record of their existence here. “This government doesn’t want to accept us as citizens of Myanmar,” Siddique said at his home in U Yin Thar, a Rohingya village of tidy wooden shacks outside the coastal town of Sittwe. As a downpour lashed the tin roofs, children scurried barefoot through muddy lanes and Siddique’s voice grew faint. “They just want to kick us out of this country,” he said. The ID push comes as the United Nations’ Human Rights Council prepares to investigate reports that the Myanmar army indiscriminately killed, raped and abused Rohingya civilians during a crackdown that began last October in northern Rakhine state, 60 miles from Sittwe. “Trust has been eroded for decades” between the Rohingya and the government, said Matthew Smith, co-founder of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group in Southeast Asia. “It’s lunacy to think that soldiers could commit atrocity crimes with impunity on Monday and have civilians happily cooperate with the [ID] scheme on Tuesday.” “There is no meaningful difference between the previous and current regimes on this issue,” he said. Myanmar has long viewed the Rohingya — who share physical, cultural and linguistic similarities with South Asian ethnic groups — as foreigners from neighboring Bangladesh, even though many families have lived here for generations. In 1982, the army enacted a law that dialed back full citizenship to include only members of 135 “national races” that purportedly existed in Burma before British colonialists invaded in 1824. The Rohingya were not included. Under the law, the best they could hope for was naturalization and a limited set of rights granted through a verification process that has proved slow and opaque. “You’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere on the planet that privileges particular ethnicities the way Myanmar does,” said Ronan Lee, a researcher at Australia’s Deakin University who has studied the Rohingya. In 2014, when the former government introduced the ID cards, it ordered the Rohingya to identify themselves as “Bengali,” a label they oppose. Last year, Suu Kyi relaunched the effort, but tried to skirt the issue of ethnicity by eliminating race and religion from the document. By early February, officials said they had issued 6,202 cards in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, home to most of the Rohingya population. Rohingya leaders say many of those were the result of coercion. This is all that remains of Abdul Shafi''s Myanmar citizenship card, which was nullified by a 1982 la Shashank Bengali / Los Angeles Times This is all that remains of Abdul Shafi''s Myanmar citizenship card, which was nullified by a 1982 law that stripped the rights of Rohingya Muslims. This is all that remains of Abdul Shafi''s Myanmar citizenship card, which was nullified by a 1982 law that stripped the rights of Rohingya Muslims. (Shashank Bengali / Los Angeles Times) Siddique said he was tricked into accepting the card as a condition of his release last month from jail. He had served 17 months for violating travel restrictions that have been strictly enforced since clashes erupted between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012 and the government confined more than 120,000 Rohingya to swampy displacement camps at the edge of Sittwe. Unable to work or study freely, thousands have attempted to escape on overcrowded fishing boats bound for Thailand and Malaysia. In October 2015, Siddique took his chances by slipping into the back of a car headed south toward the city of Yangon, but was quickly intercepted by police and arrested. The day before he was freed, he was brought to a room where a prison guard took his picture and told him to sign and leave a thumbprint on one side of what Siddique thought was a prisoner release form. When he folded the card over, his heart fell. “Identity Card for National Verification” was printed in bold letters. At home, he reluctantly showed his family the document, holding it by the edges, as if it were soiled. Although officials said the card would give him freedom of movement, police at the checkpoint that seals off his village wouldn’t let him leave. “Why did you take it?” his mother asked. He told her he had no choice, that guards had kicked him with their boots and called him kalar, a slur for dark-skinned. “I worry that the card will be used to persecute him,” said his aunt, Zurah Khatu. Siddique was born in the same village as his father, who once worked for the army. No one in the family has held a job since 2015, when authorities bowed to the demands of Buddhist nationalists and revoked the temporary IDs that had allowed the Rohingya one of their last basic rights: to vote. Unlike other controversial provisions enacted under military rule — such as blocking Suu Kyi from the presidency because she had a foreign spouse, or reserving one-quarter of parliamentary seats for the military — there is little support in Myanmar for changing the citizenship law. With Buddhist nationalists and extremist monks fanning anti-Muslim sentiment, Suu Kyi has remained largely silent on the Rohingya question. U Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyi’s party, said the government supported expanding citizenship criteria — to a point. “We want to see citizens, not ethnic groups,” he said. “But there is no such ethnic group as the Rohingya in our history.” Even Suu Kyi’s modest step has triggered protests in Rakhine state among hard-line Buddhists who complain that making Rohingya eligible for citizenship risks “Islamizing” the country — even though it’s more than 90% Buddhist. “The government should be conscious of the security of the country,” said U Aung Htay, leader of a Buddhist civil society group in Sittwe. He pointed to the deaths of nine police officers in northern Rakhine last October at the hands of alleged Rohingya militants, a series of attacks that prompted the army crackdown. “If that kind of attack happens again, people will suffer,” he said. “And you can assume the Bengali people are responsible.” Rohingya say that even if they accepted the new ID, many would have little chance of meeting the law’s onerous requirements for regaining citizenship, including “conclusive evidence” of lineage in Myanmar. In the Maw Thi Nya displacement camp outside Sittwe, 63-year-old Abdul Shafi held out his battered old citizenship card — nullified by the 1982 law — that he rescued from the 2012 clashes. Shafi said officials had visited the camp multiple times in recent months to promote the new card, and he worried the government would use their refusal as a pretext to expel Rohingya from the country. As a group of men around him nodded vigorously, he remained defiant. “We will not take this card,” he said. “Even if they kill us, we will not accept it.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can''t miss How some Central Californians are trying to save water for the state''s next dry spell. L.A. is already the top U.S. destination for Chinese tourists but can VR technology draw even bigger numbers?

(5, 'NATION Bangladesh militant hanged for attack aimed at British envoy', 'Authorities in Bangladesh have executed a top leader of a banned militant group and two accomplices for their involvement in a grenade attack against a British diplomat at a popular Islamic shrine in 2004. The attack killed three people and wounded several others. The main target was then-British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury, who narrowly escaped. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Thursday that Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Hannan and one accomplice were hanged at Kashimpur Jail outside the capital, Dhaka, late Wednesday. The third man was executed in the northeastern district of Sylhet, also late Wednesday. The High Court and the Supreme Court had upheld their death sentences given by a trial court in 2008 and the president rejected their clemency appeals. Harkatul Jihad wanted to introduce Sharia law in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people that is governed by secular laws based on British common law. The group has targeted left-leaning cultural groups and rallies of the now-ruling Bangladesh Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. It is blamed for other attacks between 1999 and 2005 that claimed more than 100 lives. Hannan was one of the most dreaded radical Islamists in Bangladesh. He joined the war in Afghanistan against the Soviets and was injured there in 1990. He became the top leader of the Harkatul Jihad in Bangladesh after his return to the country. The group was founded in Pakistan, where Hannan studied previously. The latest executions would help Bangladesh gain confidence in its fight against radial Islamists who have expanded their grip in recent years by targeting and killing atheist bloggers, writers, and foreigners and minority groups. Bangladesh has banned several radical Islamist groups in recent decades, but several domestic militant groups have been active in recent years amid a crackdown by Hasina''s government. Since July, about 55 suspected members of Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh have been killed in raids across the country. Authorities have blamed it for several recent attacks, including the siege at a restaurant in July that left 20 hostages, including 17 foreigners, dead and which was claimed by the Islamic State group.

Ahsan said the army found a huge amount of explosives in the building. Two of the four insurgents who were killed had jackets lined with explosives on them. Army and paramilitary troops had been trying since Friday to flush the militants out of building in the city of Sylhet. The six killed Saturday died after a series of explosions took place on a road near an Islamic religious school and close to the building under siege. At least 25 people were wounded in the attacks and 78 civilians rescued from the building after troops broke a section of the compound wall where the building is located the army spokesman said. Several explosions occurred in the area, including a large blast Sunday afternoon. Police barred civilians, including journalists, from the area. The gunbattle with suspected militants came after a man killed himself on Friday by detonating explosives near a police post on a busy road near the airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh''s capital. No one else was hurt. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Sylhet and Dhaka, according to the SITE Intelligence group, citing the Islamic State news agency Amaq. SITE monitors terror group activity online. Bangladesh has experienced a renewed level of Islamic militancy in recent years. Dozens of atheists, liberal writers, bloggers and publishers, as well as members of minority communities and foreigners, have been targeted and killed. Last July, 17 foreigners were killed when five militants stormed a restaurant in Dhaka''s upscale diplomatic zone. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. But Bangladesh''s government has consistently denied the presence of the militant group in the impoverished South Asian nation, and says the attacks are the work of local radical groups.

After some 6,000 migrants were rescued from the Mediterranean in dozens of operations coordinated by the Italian coast guard on Friday and Saturday, hundreds more migrants were plucked to safety Sunday from dinghies and fishing boats. The humanitarian group MOAS tweeted Sunday that it had helped several hundred migrants in nine rubber dinghies and two wooden boats over a 24-hour period. MOAS also recovered seven bodies, including that of an 8-year-old boy. It also distributed life vests to 1,000 migrants still on smugglers'' boats who are awaiting transfers to the rescue ships that will bring them to southern Italian ports.

(8, 'NATION Hungary lawmakers debate bill that critics say is anti-NGO', 'Hungarian lawmakers began debating a draft bill on Wednesday that critics say is meant to intimidate non-governmental organizations which receive foreign financing. Among other conditions, NGOs getting more than 7.2 million forints ($24,600) a year from abroad would have to register with the courts and identify themselves as being foreign-funded on their websites and publications. Failure to comply could lead to fines or termination of the groups. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, one of the affected NGOs, said that the law was "devastating." The proposal "is another attempt by the government to silence public opinion on public matters," the organization said. "The bill ... is devastating. It will have a chilling effect on independent opinions on the government''s affairs and it hands the government a tool to suppress differing opinions." Lawmakers from Prime Minister Viktor Orban''s Fidesz party said that the only aim of the law was to achieve greater transparency in the civil sector. Fidesz claims that some of the NGOs in question, like rights advocate the Hungarian Helsinki Committee and corruption watchdog Transparency International, are "foreign agents" and part of a network financed by billionaire George Soros to influence Hungarian politics. "The Soros empire set out to promote the cause of migrants and mass migration," Orban said Sunday on state radio. "This is now about the security of the Hungarian people, the security of Hungary, the protection of the borders, public security and terrorism. On this there can be no compromise." Orban is staunchly anti-migration, with Hungary building razor-wire fences on its southern borders in 2015 to stop the flow of migrants passing through the country on their way to Western Europe. The Helsinki Committee, for example, has earned the government''s wrath because it offers legal counsel to asylum-seekers and recently represented two men from Bangladesh who won a judgment against Hungary at the European Court of Human Rights after they were expelled illegally to Serbia in 2015. Members of the opposition compared the legislation to similar rules introduced in Russia and efforts by Hungary''s communist regime, which ended in 1990. "This law not only wants to make enemies of the civic groups but also seeks to destroy them morally," said Erzsebet Schmuck of the green party Politics Can Be Different. Religious and sports organizations, as well as certain funding received from the European Union would be exempt from the law, expected to be passed next month. The NGO law comes on the back of amendments to a law on higher education, passed two weeks ago, which were seen as targeting Budapest-based Central European University, founded by Soros in 1991. The U.S. State Department, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as hundreds of Hungarian and foreign academics and dozens of universities protested the "lex CEU," which opposition lawmakers announced they would appeal to the Constitutional Court. The recent legislation has also earned criticism from conservative groups usually supportive of Orban and even U.S. backers of Hungarian causes. "Regrettably ... the Hungarian government has chosen to focus energy on the ill-conceived legislation attacking NGOs and the prestigious American university, CEU, which is quickly deteriorating bilateral relations," said Maximilian Teleki, president emeritus of the nonprofit Hungarian American Coalition based in Washington. "This is yet another unforced error that is deeply concerning to the Hungarian-American diaspora." Numerous rallies over the past weeks in Budapest opposing the two laws have been presented by the government as proof that despite the opposition''s criticism of Orban''s increasingly authoritarian tendencies, Hungary remains a healthy democracy.

(9, 'TRAVEL Cruises Saving lives, 1 day at a time, on the deadly Mediterranean', 'As usual, it started with a call on a satellite phone from Italian rescue officials in Rome. They were relaying a distress call they''d received from a migrant smuggling ship adrift somewhere off the coast of Libya.  On board the Golfo Azurro, Guillermo Canardo was taking notes. "Two boats," he said. "One hundred people in each one." He paused, then asked the question that needed to be asked: "Are they (the migrants) still moving?"  A fishing trawler-turned-exploration yacht-turned-rescue ship, the 30-year-old Golfo Azurro is now operated by Proactiva Open Arms, a Spanish nonprofit dedicated to rescuing migrants before they are consumed by the unforgiving Mediterranean Sea. It works the SAR zone — the search-and-rescue zone — which starts 12 nautical miles from the Libyan coast and goes 12 miles deeper into the sea''s unpredictable waters. This is the last, deadliest section of the migrant highway known as "the Libyan route" that slices across the African continent. According to UNHCR, an average of 14 people died in the Mediterranean every day in 2016, the highest number ever recorded.  Canardo, the head of rescue operations on the Golfo Azurro, spoke that April day to Italy''s Maritime Rescue Coordination Center, which passed along the troubled vessels'' coordinates.  Half a dozen rescuers quickly put on wetsuits and loaded sacks of lifejackets onto two orange rubber rescue boats. Fernando Garfella, skipper of the lead rescue boat, confirmed the coordinates and sped toward the target. After 15 minutes, a dot appeared on the horizon.   Most migrants on the Mediterranean are now trying to reach Italy. Those numbers have dramatically increased since the European Union and Turkey signed an agreement last year that allowed Greece to send new asylum-seekers back to Turkey. In exchange, the EU agreed to speed up visas for Turkish citizens and donate 6 billion euros ($6.4 billion) to help support the hundreds of thousands of refugees living on Turkish soil. Over the long Easter weekend, at least 8,300 migrants were rescued at sea, according to a U.N. refugee agency official, Carlotta Sami, who tweeted Monday that "rescuers worked incessantly for three days." At least eight bodies were recovered.  With the Greek smuggling route largely closed off, the path of least resistance has drifted to Libya — a sprawling, lawless country with a huge coast and competing rebel and government factions. Migrants have flooded into Libya from across Africa, producing a bonanza for smugglers.  The first call for help often comes on a satellite telephone directly from a smuggling boat.  On that April day, rescuers found two jam-packed boats with 152 people — 66 in a rubber boat, 86 in a wooden boat — 56 nautical miles (103 kilometers) from the Libyan coast. Fede Gomez, an Argentine rescuer, told those on the inflatable boat in English to remain calm if they wanted to avoid a tragedy. Boats have capsized previously — leading to dozens of drownings — when desperate migrants jumped into the water trying to be rescued first.  The rubber boat had left Libya thirteen hours earlier, traveling overnight and drifting since its small engine broke down. It was truly a makeshift craft — a rubber floater glued to a wooden base and held together by screws as large as a hand. There was no food or drinkable water left, and nowhere near enough fuel to reach Italian soil. The migrants were told that Europe was only five hours north of Libya. In fact, the closest point is Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island 160 nautical miles away, a boat journey that takes more than 32 hours in calm waters.  This group was lucky enough to reach an offshore oil well platform, guided by its burning flame, and rescue workers linked up with them near it.  Once everyone had been transferred to the Golfo Azurro, a rescuer destroyed one of the smuggling boats'' engines — the other was broken hours ago. That ensures that no "vultures" — the nickname for the local fishermen who scavenge the engines of smugglers'' boats — can sell them back again to more traffickers. The rescuers'' anger toward the smugglers is palpable, coming out in unprintable torrents.  Hours pass by, more migrants are rescued at sea. Eventually 230 are on aboard, coming from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Niger, Mali, Eritrea, Guinea and Sudan, among other countries. The boat now heads to Trapani, Sicily. It has to slow down, since it''s Thursday afternoon and passengers can''t be taken off until Saturday morning. If the boat gets into port too early, the rescuers fear the migrants will jump into the water and try to swim to Italy.  Each rescue brings another story, often full of heartbreak but with a common theme — a dream for a better life, an escape from fear or hunger.  Yakubu Yahya, a 17-year-old from Niger, went to Libya searching for his missing parents and was kidnapped in the Libyan city of Sabha while crossing the Saharan Desert. His kidnappers demanded $2,000 — an unimaginable figure to him — and he was beaten almost constantly until he managed to escape. Eventually, he found enough work in Libya to scrape together $400 — enough to pay a smuggler to get him to the coast and then get onto the smuggler''s boat.  Nuy Hassen, 16, left Eritrea when he was six and spent a decade traveling through Ethiopia, Sudan and the Sahara Desert. Along the way, his friends were killed by smugglers because they got sick and couldn''t keep up. When he finally reached Libya, he was kidnapped and held for 7 months. He''s so traumatized that no one can figure out his full story.  Mohammed Abdullah, a 32-year-old from Equatorial Guinea, explained how smugglers demand payment through some of the world''s best-known money transfer companies, often via Gulf countries. Along the way, nearly everyone the migrants encounter is corrupt — including the Libyan military boat that escorted them for an hour after they left the beach at Zuwara. He says Libya was simply awful. "If I had known how it was in Libya, I never would have gone," he said. "I don''t know how to explain Libya."  The migrants kept off the Libyan streets as much as they could, afraid of being kidnapped. If they are taken, kidnappers often hang their victims by their feet or fire off guns near their heads as their families are called on the phone, to terrify the families into paying ransoms.  Yet on the Golfo, good moments sometimes break out. Like when Ibo, a 23-year-old Gambian, sings Bob Marley''s "One Love" — and others follow with classical Bangladeshi songs and Shakira''s "Waka, Waka." At sundown, a whale joins the boat on the starboard side. On Saturday morning, the Trapani harbor beckons. After paperwork, police inspections and medical check-ups, the 230 migrants are allowed to go ashore in Europe. They thank their rescuers, hug each other to celebrate. Most, though, don''t understand that this could be just one more step in an impossible dream. Many will be sent to government-run migrant camps. Others, depending on international agreements, will be sent back home. Looming ahead for many is a frightening question: Do they dare venture again across the Mediterranean?

The 80-year-old pope referred to his own mortality twice in the span of a few minutes during a vigil service to rally enthusiasm for the Catholic Church''s World Youth Day, to be held in Panama in 2019. "I don''t know if it will be me, but the pope will be in Panama!" he told the crowd at the St. Mary Major basilica. A few minutes earlier, he drew gasps from the pews when he teased: "At my age, we (old people) are about to pass away." Sensing their pained reaction, he added: "Who guarantees life? No one. At your age, you have the future ahead of you." Francis is known for his casual, self-deprecating remarks and has said repeatedly he didn''t expect to be pope for very long. Early on in his four-year papacy he predicted two to five years would do it. He has also not ruled out the possibility of resigning like his predecessor, Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, did. At the same time, there''s nothing indicating that Francis is slowing down. Later this month, he begins the first of his 2017 foreign travels that are expected to bring him to Egypt, Portugal, Colombia, India, Bangladesh and perhaps South Sudan. He is also gearing up for the next big meeting of the world''s bishops this fall, dedicated to young people. The Vatican has solicited direct input from young people to inform its work and participate in the synod. Francis took that request further Saturday, saying he wanted to involve not just dedicated Catholics but all young people, atheists included. "The future is in your hands," he said. The synod lets bishops make proposals to the pope that inform a future papal document. Francis'' last synod on the family was highly divisive on the issues of marriage, divorce and access to the sacraments. ___ Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(12, 'Sports LA Olympics campaign gets lots of likes - from Pakistan', 'More than a million Facebook users like the idea of hosting the 2024 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Many of them, oddly enough, from Pakistan. A report prepared for The Associated Press says most of LA''s likes have come in the past six weeks from far away from Southern California. "The fan growth evolution for the LA2024 Facebook page does seem suspicious," said analyst Michaela Branova, whose Prague, Czech Republic-based firm, Socialbakers, drew up the report. "Countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan suddenly spike from almost zero to tens of thousands of fans within a few days in February." LA campaign spokesman Jeff Millman said there was nothing suspicious about the figures. He said LA kicked off a series of Facebook advertisements starting Feb. 3. The scale and the mechanics of the advertising campaign weren''t made clear - Millman declined to divulge how much LA 2024 had spent on promotion - but he noted that Facebook ads were "more efficient in countries where there are fewer competing brands." He argued that it made sense to seek fans internationally. "We are a global campaign, as the Olympic movement is global," he said. Socialbakers'' figures, which were commissioned by the AP, give some insight into the dynamics of both the Paris and Los Angeles'' social media campaigns. By the end of 2016, Los Angeles had 209,000 or so likes, nearly all of which came from the United States, according to Socialbakers. Paris had 62,000 or so fans, 80 percent of which came from France. By last week both sides'' figures had grown. Paris'' Facebook page tripled its following, but four out of five endorsements came from France, with many of the others originating in Algeria and Tunisia, former French colonies. Los Angeles saw an explosion in support from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Egypt, India, Afghanistan and other low-income countries, according to Socialbakers'' research. In Bangladesh alone, the number of supporters of the U.S. Olympic bid rose from a few dozen to 113,335 in a month-and-a-half. In Pakistan, the number of supporters leapt from 55 to 99,336 over the same period. Socialbakers'' report said that more than 700,000 of the 1 million accounts that liked LA 2024''s Facebook page had done so within the past six weeks. The surge helped LA blow past Paris (about 235,000 likes) and hit the million mark at an opportune moment. An Olympics conference started Tuesday in Denmark, the first of three events between now and September, when the International Olympic Committee is scheduled to pick one city over the other. Socialbakers said it wasn''t working for the LA or Paris bid, and that its work was transparent. "It''s all publicly available, taken directly from the Facebook API," said spokeswoman Claire Wilson, referring to Facebook''s data interface. Branova and outside experts said it was possible that a large chunk of LA''s social media support was drummed up by advertisements or other paid methods. "It''s consistent with what you''d expect to see from paid endorsements," said Daniel Mochon, who teaches social media marketing at Tulane University''s A. B. Freeman School of Business. "They tend to come from developing countries ... You''re going to see sudden spikes that are not necessarily tied to anything external." Social media support has been invoked as a selling point by the LA bid, which is locked in competition with Paris for the chance to host the Summer Games. On Monday, LA 2024 released a statement crowing about how its campaign had passed the 1 million follower mark. That was endorsed by Nathan Cowan of Seattle-based digital marketing analytics firm Rival IQ, which wasn''t involved in the report. Cowan said that while hadn''t seen the raw data, Socialbakers'' work "appears to be entirely accurate." Cowan echoed Socialbakers'' suspicions about LA''s numbers, noting the "extreme spike in followers" and their unusual geographic breakdown. Paris 2024 officials declined to comment. Facebook declined comment, saying in an email that it was up to advertisers to disclose how they promoted their pages. The IOC did not offer any comment, but the group''s rules of conduct note that promotion of a city''s bid must take place "with dignity and moderation." ___ Satter contributed from London.

(13, 'NATION South African parliament speaker weighs no confidence motion', 'South Africa''s speaker of parliament said she is considering an emergency motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma after he fired the country''s widely respected finance minister last week. Baleka Mbete said Sunday that she cut short an overseas trip to deal with the "serious parliamentary issues" that have arisen since Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet last week. Mbete, speaking to Johannesburg at Johannesburg airport upon her arrival from Bangladesh, said her office received a letter from the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, requesting that the national assembly, which is in recess until May 10, resume earlier to vote on the motion. The request for the motion, which would result in Zuma having to step down if it is passed, must be assessed to see if it is compliant with the parliament''s rules, she said. Opposition parties need 201 legislators out of 400 to vote for the motion to pass, but is uncertain if they will garner adequate numbers in a parliament dominated by the ruling African National Congress. Zuma has easily survived earlier votes of no confidence. However top ANC members have been vocal in their criticism of Zuma in recent days and they might not support him as before. "I must stress that I am alive to the extreme challenges and sense of anxiety our young democracy is going through at this moment," Mbete said. "South Africans are expecting our institutions of democracy such as parliament to demonstrate decisive leadership. This is a responsibility that parliament, for its part, does not take lightly." The currency of one of Africa''s most industrialized economies slipped sharply on Friday amid concerns about corruption at top levels of government after Zuma fired finance minister Pravin Gordhan and replaced him with one of his allies. Gordhan was seen as a bulwark against corruption and his sacking set off an outcry by anti-Zuma factions in the ruling African National Congress and opposition parties. Economists say it is likely that South Africa, which saw economic growth of just 0.5 percent last year and has an unemployment rate of around 27 percent, will be downgraded to junk status by credit ratings agencies. Calls have been growing for Zuma to step down since August last year when the ANC lost control of key metropolitan areas in local elections, partly because of dissatisfaction with the president''s performance. Although the ANC''s reputation as the main movement against apartheid has been tainted, it is still seen as the front-runner ahead of general elections in 2019. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(14, 'NATION South African president may face no-confidence motion', 'JOHANNESBURG  South African Parliament Speaker Baleka Mbete said she''s considering a request to recall lawmakers to debate an opposition-sponsored motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, after he made Cabinet changes that top ruling party officials said was done without consulting them. "Given the seriousness inherent in the motions of no confidence and their implication on the nation, I have therefore decided to cut my trip to Bangladesh short to ensure that these requests are given the appropriate consideration," Mbete said Sunday. Parliament is on its Easter recess. Zuma and his Cabinet would have to resign if a no-confidence motion succeeds, Masibulele Xaso, the National Assembly secretary, said at a briefing. Mbete ruled out a secret ballot in a possible vote, saying it''s not in the rules of Parliament. The announcement followed increased pressure from the African National Congress and opposition parties that''s been building on the president since he fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and made 19 other changes to his administration Friday. The demand for action by Parliament came from the main opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Front. The decision by Zuma to fire Gordhan, with whom he feuded over control of state finances, and to not consult with his top party officials on the other Cabinet changes brought to the open South Africa''s biggest political crisis in almost a decade. Zuma replaced Gordhan with former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, who has no financial or business experience. The ANC has used its 62 percent majority in the 400-seat National Assembly to block four motions of no confidence, which required a simple majority to pass, and one impeachment attempt filed by the opposition since Zuma took office in May 2009. The outcome this time is less certain after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe and Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize publicly questioned the manner in which the Cabinet changes were handled. The three make up half of the party''s committee of top officials. Jackson Mthembu, the ANC''s chief whip in Parliament, also criticized the decision to fire Gordhan, while the South African Communist Party, which is in an alliance with the ANC, urged Zuma to quit, describing his actions as "recklessness." Mbete said that it isn''t in the ANC''s "culture" to publicly criticize its leaders and that there''s no rule forcing the president to consult with the party''s top echelons to discuss Cabinet changes. Mkhize said the president''s failure to consult the ANC''s top leadership about the rest of the Cabinet changes "left a distinct impression that the ANC is no longer the center" of decision making in the government. ANC leaders are scheduled to meet on Monday. The Cabinet changes were made less than nine months before Zuma is due to step down as ANC leader, and a year after the nation''s top court found that he violated his oath of office when he refused to repay public money spent on his private home. His second and final term as the nation''s president is due to end in 2019. "I am alive to the extreme challenges and sense of anxiety that our young democracy is going through at this moment," Mbete said. "Our people are looking to Parliament to play its part and exercise its constitutional responsibilities."  (Sam Mkokeli and Mike Cohen contributed to this report.)

The first lady, on her first visit to a Cabinet department, joined Thomas Shannon, undersecretary of state for political affairs, to present the Secretary of State''s International Women of Courage Award. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was traveling to Turkey. The award is given to women around the world who have shown courage and leadership while advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality and women''s empowerment — often at personal risk. One of the honorees, Natalia Ponce de Leon, of Colombia, started a foundation to defend and protect the human rights of victims of acid attacks after a stalker doused her face and body with sulfuric acid in March 2014. Another woman, Malebogo Molefhe, of Botswana, became an advocate for female victims of gender-based violence after she was attacked, including being shot eight times, by an ex-boyfriend in 2009. She uses a wheelchair due to injuries suffered during the assault. During brief remarks, Mrs. Trump asked the audience to imagine being any of the 13 women on stage with her. "Ask yourself if you would have the fortitude of spirit, the courage of your convictions and the enormous inner strength required to stand up and fight against such overwhelming odds," she said. "Amazingly, each of our honorees has courageously answered ''Yes'' to those questions." "These honorees, who have fought on the front lines against injustice, are true heroes," she continued, adding that their bravery is a reminder that "there is always hope whenever the human spirit is brought to bear in the service of others." Wednesday''s honorees hail from Bangladesh, Botswana, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Sri Lanka, Syria, Turkey, Vietnam and Yemen. In April, the women will take part in a State Department-sponsored exchange program in several U.S. cities. More than 100 women from more than 60 countries have been recognized with courage awards since 2007, the department said. Mrs. Trump''s participation in the award ceremony amounted to a rare public appearance for her in Washington, outside of the White House. She hosted a White House luncheon for International Women''s Day earlier this month. Wednesday''s appearance also fell in the middle of a busy week in the nation''s capital for the first lady. She and President Donald Trump hosted a White House reception Tuesday night for all 100 U.S. senators and their spouses. Mrs. Trump also planned a third appearance Thursday in Washington, but the White House has not released any details. After joining Shannon at the State Department, the first lady later appeared at a White House panel discussion on women''s empowerment, where Trump introduced his wife, a former model, as a "very highly accomplished woman." He mentioned that her poll numbers are higher than his, and also said she "feels so strongly about" empowering women. Since her husband''s Jan. 20 inauguration, the first lady has lived mostly at the family''s Trump Tower penthouse in midtown Manhattan with the couple''s son, Barron, 11. She often meets the president in Palm Beach, Florida, when he spends weekends at his waterfront estate there. Trump has said his wife and son will move to the White House after Barron''s school year ends. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The men who came from a far-away place and spoke a strange language offered the Haitian children cookies and other snacks. Sometimes they gave them a few dollars. But the price was high: The Sri Lankan peacekeepers wanted sex from girls and boys as young as 12. "I did not even have breasts," said a girl, known as V01 — Victim No. 1. She told U.N. investigators that over the next three years, from ages 12 to 15, she had sex with nearly 50 peacekeepers, including a "Commandant" who gave her 75 cents.

An Associated Press investigation of U.N. missions during the past 12 years found nearly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other personnel around the world — signaling the crisis is much larger than previously known. More than 300 of the allegations involved children, the AP found, but only a fraction of the alleged perpetrators served jail time. Legally, the U.N. is in a bind. It has no jurisdiction over peacekeepers, leaving punishment to the countries that contribute the troops. The AP interviewed alleged victims, current and former U.N. officials and investigators and sought answers from 23 countries on the number of peacekeepers who faced such allegations and, what if anything, was done to investigate. With rare exceptions, few nations responded to repeated requests, while the names of those found guilty are kept confidential, making accountability impossible to determine. Without agreement for widespread reform and accountability from the U.N.''s member states, solutions remain elusive. Here in Haiti, at least 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers exploited nine children in a sex ring from 2004 to 2007, according to an internal U.N. report obtained by the AP. In the wake of the report, 114 peacekeepers were sent home. None was ever imprisoned. In March, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced new measures to tackle sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel. But the proclamation had a depressingly familiar ring: More than a decade ago, the United Nations commissioned a report that promised to do much the same thing, yet most of the reforms never materialized. For a full two years after those promises were made, the children in Haiti were passed around from soldier to soldier. And in the years since, peacekeepers have been accused of sexual abuse the world over. In response to the AP''s investigation, the U.N.''s head of field support said Wednesday the international body was aware of shortcomings in the system. "We believe we are advancing in the right direction, especially with the secretary-general''s new approach," said Atul Khare who heads the U.N. department in charge of peacekeeper discipline and conduct. "Improving the assistance provided to victims, who are at the heart of our response, is fundamental." Khare also said the organization was working with member states to hold perpetrators to account. In one particularly grim case in Haiti, a teenage boy said he was gang-raped in 2011 by Uruguayan peacekeepers who filmed the alleged assault on a cellphone. Dozens of Haitian women also say they were raped, and dozens more had what is euphemistically called "survival sex" in a country where most people live on less than $2.50 a day, the AP found. Haitian lawyer Mario Joseph has been trying to get compensation for victims of a deadly cholera strain linked to Nepalese peacekeepers that killed an estimated 10,000 people. Now, he is also trying to get child support for about a dozen Haitian women left pregnant by peacekeepers. "Imagine if the U.N. was going to the United States and raping children and bringing cholera," Joseph said in Port-au-Prince. "Human rights aren''t just for rich white people." U.S. Sen. Bob Corker agrees. The Tennessee Republican, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been calling for reforms in the United Nations. He may well get them under President Donald Trump, whose administration has proposed a 31 percent reduction to the U.S. foreign aid and diplomacy budget. Corker and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley want a review of all missions. Corker recalled his disgust at hearing of the U.N. sexual abuse cases uncovered last year in Central African Republic. "If I heard that a U.N. peacekeeping mission was coming near my home in Chattanooga," he told AP, "I''d be on the first plane out of here to go back and protect my family." ___ The Habitation Leclerc resort was once well known throughout Port-au-Prince as a lush refuge amid the capital''s grimy alleyways. During its heyday in the 1980s, celebrities like Mick Jagger and Jackie Onassis would perch by the pool or stroll past the property''s Voodoo temple. By 2004, the resort was a decrepit clutch of buildings, and several children, either orphaned or abandoned by their parents, were living in its ruins. It was there that V01 met other victims, two girls referred to in the U.N. report as "V02" and "V03" and a young boy, "V08." The boy initially supported them by occasionally bringing food from his aunt, but they were often hungry. The peacekeepers had arrived that year as part of a new mission to help stabilize Haiti in the wake of President Jean-Bertrande Aristide''s ouster. The Sri Lankans, numbering about 900 troops, landed in a historically unstable country in the grip of scattered violence and kidnappings — and a broken government ill-suited to confront the chaos. Some of the peacekeepers in the Sri Lankan contingent were based near the former resort. In August 2007, the U.N. received complaints of "suspicious interactions" between Sri Lankan soldiers and Haitian children. U.N. investigators then interviewed nine victims, as well as witnesses, while the sex ring was still active. V02, who was 16 when the U.N. team interviewed her, told them she had sex with a Sri Lankan commander at least three times, describing him as overweight with a moustache and a gold ring on his middle finger. She said he often showed her a picture of his wife. The peacekeepers also taught her some Sinhalese so she could understand and express sexual innuendo; the children even talked to one another in Sinhalese when U.N. investigators were interviewing them. V03 identified 11 Sri Lankan troops through photographs, one of whom she said was a corporal with a "distinctive" bullet scar between his armpit and waist. V04, who was 14, said she had sex with the soldiers every day in exchange for money, cookies or juice. During her interview with investigators, another young victim, V07, received a phone call from a Sri Lankan peacekeeper. She explained that the soldiers would pass along her number to incoming contingent members, who would then call her for sex. The boy, V08, said he had sex with more than 20 Sri Lankans. Most would remove their name tags before taking him to U.N. military trucks, where he gave them oral sex or was sodomized by them. Another boy, V09, was 15 when his encounters began. Over the course of three years, he said he had sex with more than 100 Sri Lankan peacekeepers, averaging about four a day, investigators said. Under Haitian law, having sex with someone under 18 is statutory rape. U.N. codes of conduct also prohibit exploitation. "The sexual acts described by the nine victims are simply too many to be presented exhaustively in this report, especially since each claimed multiple sexual partners at various locations where the Sri Lankan contingents were deployed throughout Haiti over several years," the report said. Investigators showed the children more than 1,000 photographs that included pictures of Sri Lankan troops and locations of where the children had sex with the soldiers. "The evidence shows that from late 2004 to mid-October 2007, at least 134 military members of the current and previous Sri Lankan contingents sexually exploited and abused at least nine Haitian children," the report said. After the report was filed, 114 Sri Lanka peacekeepers were sent home, putting an end to the sex ring. But the sexual exploitation visited upon Haiti''s people didn''t stop there. ___ Janila Jean said she was a 16-year-old virgin when a Brazilian peacekeeper lured her to a U.N. compound three years ago with a smear of peanut butter on bread, raped her at gunpoint and left her pregnant. She finds herself constantly in tears. "Some days, I imagine strangling my daughter to death," she said in an interview under the shadow of banana palms near the former Jacmel base. With her were three other women who said they also were raped by peacekeepers. One of them sat on her heels, scraping coconut from its shell and into a large cauldron of water and corn, the barest of meals for the women and their small children. Adm. Ademir Sobrinho of Brazil''s armed forces said at a conference in London that his force had no such cases of rape, sexual abuse or sexual exploitation. But like many, Jean didn''t report the rape. Nearly a dozen women interviewed by the AP said they were too scared to report the crimes out of fear they would be blamed — or worse, would meet their victimizers again. The AP found that some 150 allegations of abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel were reported in Haiti alone between 2004 and 2016, out of the worldwide total of nearly 2,000. Aside from the Sri Lankan sex ring in Haiti, some perpetrators were jailed for other cases. Alleged abusers came from Bangladesh, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uruguay and Sri Lanka, according to U.N. data and interviews. More countries may have been involved, but the United Nations only started disclosing alleged perpetrators'' nationalities after 2015. The litany of abuses is long. In July 2011, four Uruguayan peacekeepers and their commanding officer allegedly gang-raped a Haitian teenager. The men also filmed the alleged attack on their phones, which went viral on the internet. The men never faced trial in Haiti; four of the five were convicted in Uruguay of "private violence," a lesser charge. Uruguayan officials said at the time that it was a prank gone wrong and that no rape occurred. The following year, three Pakistanis attached to the U.N.''s police units in Haiti were allegedly involved in the rape of a mentally disabled 13-year-old in the northern city of Gonaives. U.N. officials went to Haiti to investigate, but the Pakistanis abducted the boy to keep him from detailing the abuse that had gone on for more than a year, according to Peter Gallo, a former U.N. investigator familiar with the case. Finally, the men were tried in a Pakistani military tribunal, and eventually sent back to Pakistan. In theory, the tribunal could have allowed for better access to witnesses, but it''s unclear whether any were called. The Pakistani authorities also refused to allow the U.N. to observe the proceedings. In the end, one man was sent to prison for a year, according to Ariane Quentier, a spokeswoman for the Haiti mission. "It''s an indictment of how the whole U.N. system works," Gallo told the AP. Pakistan''s military has refused several requests for comment on the case. U.N. data during the 12-year period reviewed by AP is incomplete and varies in levels of detail, particularly for cases before 2010. Hundreds of other cases were closed with little to no explanation. In its review, the AP analyzed data from annual reports as well as information from the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In the wake of the child sex ring investigation, a team of Sri Lankans spent two weeks in Haiti in October 2007. They interviewed only 25 soldiers out of more than 900 in the country and concluded that just two Sri Lankan corporals and one private had sex with two "young" victims. Three soldiers denied sexual encounters but were suspected of lying, according to the U.N. investigation report. For six months, the Sri Lankan army and the government declined to respond to AP''s questions about the 2007 case. Instead, officials first dodged repeated queries, then gave vague assurances that the scandal represented an isolated incident. Last month, the Sri Lankan government acknowledged its military had conducted inquiries into just 18 soldiers it said were implicated, and that "the U.N. Secretariat has acknowledged in writing, action taken by the Government, and informed that the Secretariat, as of 29 September 2014, considers the matter closed." Some of the peacekeepers involved in the ring were still in the Sri Lankan military as of last year, Sri Lankan military officials say. The United Nations, meanwhile, continued to send Sri Lankan peacekeepers to Haiti and elsewhere despite corroborating the child sex ring. Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi defended the troops, saying, "People are quite happy and comfortable with the peacekeepers." ___ Above a rusty bench at an abandoned bus stop in the village of Leogane hangs a sign that reads, "Constructed by the 16th Sri Lanka Peacekeeping Battalion." It''s one of the few physical reminders of the battalion''s mission — along with children fathered by U.N. personnel. Marie-Ange Haitis says she met a Sri Lankan commander in December 2006 and he soon began making night-time visits to her house in Leogane. "By January, we had had sex," she said. "It wasn''t rape, but it wasn''t exactly consensual, either. I felt like I didn''t have a choice." She said when she first realized that she was pregnant, the Haitian translator assigned to the Sri Lankans told her to have an abortion. Then, she said, U.N. officials accused her of lying. As she spoke, her daughter Samantha sat on her lap wearing an oversized pair of sunglasses with a missing lens. When she was interviewed in August, Haitis said she had been waiting nearly a decade for the U.N. to consider her paternity claim to help support her daughter. Finally, early this year, Sri Lankan and U.N. officials told AP that a onetime payment of $45,243 had been made for Haitis'' daughter. The United Nations said Sri Lanka accepted the paternity claim without proof of DNA and the commander was dismissed from service. But such payments are rare. U.N. officials said they were unable to find any members of the mission in Haiti who might have dealt with the victims in the sex-ring case and did not know what happened to the children. An Italian non-governmental organization, AVSI, said it helped the children by trying to find homes for them, providing them with counseling and helping reintegrate them into schools, but it also lost track of the children shortly after the country''s devastating 2010 earthquake. Khare, the U.N. head of field support, acknowledged the scope of the problem and said the global agency must do more to help victims, including gathering accurate information and following up with troop-contributing countries. "What we all want to see is justice been served for the victims of these horrendous acts," he said. An AP review of reports on the conduct of U.N. field missions showed haphazard record-keeping. In a 2008 report, for example, 19 allegations were reported in Haiti — a number that seemed to contradict the U.N.''s own investigation report in late 2007 that identified nine children and 134 peacekeepers in the sex ring. Before 2010, the number of allegations involving minors was not specified for all U.N. missions. Some Haitians wonder whether the U.N. has done more harm than good in a country that has endured tragedy after tragedy since it became the first black republic in 1804. U.N. personnel say they have contributed to the stability in the Caribbean nation over the years, saved lives during the 2010 earthquake''s aftermath and prevented violence during periods of unrest. The mission, which currently has nearly 5,000 personnel and is expected to scale down by October, has also been credited with training police, providing security during elections and support to the judiciary. "I would not say we have achieved everything we set out to do, but we are engaged in a process of continuous improvement that any harmful effect on the local populations could be minimized, if not completely eradicated," Khare said. Many here are not convinced. "I''d like to see my attacker face to face and tell him how he has destroyed my life," said 21-year-old Melida Joseph, who said she was raped by one peacekeeper and narrowly escaped being gang-raped in Cite-Soleil, a seaside slum. Like others, she never reported the crime. "They''ll look at this as one big joke," she said. "As far as the U.N. goes, they came here to protect us, but all they''ve brought is destruction." ___ Dodds reported from several locations in Haiti and London and Geneva. Others who contributed to the report were Katy Daigle in Colombo, Sri Lanka; Verena Dobnik and Jennifer Peltz in New York; Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal; Kathy Gannon in Islamabad, Pakistan; Saleh Mwanamilongo in Kinshasa, Congo; Francis Kokutse in Accra, Ghana; Brahima Ouedraogo in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; and Sylivester Domasa in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

(17, 'NATION Arab populists also blame foreigners as Gulf austerity sets in', 'DUBAI The angst against foreigners that''s sweeping the globe isn''t skipping the oil-rich Middle East. Safa Al-Hashem, the only woman in Kuwait''s 50-seat parliament, is capitalizing on a growing resentment of foreigners to build support for a movement that''s taking shape as the nation''s ruling al-Sabah family withdraws some handouts in an era of cheap oil. "Before asking citizens to pay, the government should reform the population mix by levying taxes on foreigners," said the 52-year-old former investment banker, whose salt-and-pepper pixie-cropped hair and attire of smart business suits make her stand out among exclusively male counterparts in white gowns and headdresses. "The citizen feels that our entitlements lack social justice." Voices of discontent in Kuwait''s legislature, the most independent in the Gulf, provide a rare glimpse into how locals are reacting as cash-strapped monarchs from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates risk their legitimacy by overhauling social contracts that cemented decades of largely autocratic rule. Kuwait''s rulers "have to manage a very delicate transition," said Graham Griffiths, an analyst at global risk consultancy Control Risks in Dubai. "The issue for them is managing the economic reforms they see as necessary, while placating populist pressures amid broader demand for political reform and accountability." Al-Hashem''s brand of populism is unique to the nation of 4.4 million sandwiched between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where migrant workers outnumber locals 3-to-1 and, unlike elsewhere in the Gulf, get subsidized health care and education. It''s all the more striking because the nation exists only because more than two dozen countries came to its rescue 26 years ago to force out Saddam Hussein. She wants the Egyptians, Syrians, Indians and Bangladeshis who do the plumbing and teach students to be deported or get taxed for "walking on the roads" if they stay. "They''re sucking up the state''s resources," said the Harvard Business School graduate, who won her seat in a November election that saw Kuwaitis oust more than half of the incumbents to protest the first gasoline price hike in decades, which took the cost of premium fuel to 165 fils (55 cents), up 83 percent according to local press. The message is gaining traction. Al-Hashem, who has more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, has been elected three times since late 2012. Meanwhile, pressure is intensifying for Kuwait to cut a subsidy bill that mushroomed five-fold to 5.1 billion dinars ($17 billion) in the decade to 2015. Reluctant to deplete its $592 billion wealth fund meant to preserve cash for future generations, the nation borrowed from the international debt markets for the first time last month, raising $8 billion. Regular clashes between lawmakers and government officials appointed by the Al-Sabahs have delayed investment projects in recent years, leaving Kuwait behind peers in weaning its economy off oil. While parliament can make laws, veto state decisions and hold ministers to account, Emir Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah regularly dissolves it when tensions run too high. It last happened in October after ministers came under fire for the subsidy cuts. But the election weeks later bolstered an opposition united in blaming foreigners for deteriorating public services. Among them is Abdulkarim Al-Kandari, who holds a doctorate in commercial law from University of Strasbourg in France. One evening last month in Kuwait City, he convened with nearly two dozen citizens for a traditional diwaniya, a gathering where Kuwaiti men sit on wall-to-wall sofas to discuss the issues of the day. The banner hanging above them in Arabic read "the population imbalance," a telling indication of a pressing worry. "We are not setting up a Trump wing here," Al-Kandari said, refuting the idea that developments in Kuwait resemble the anti-immigrant sentiment that catapulted Donald Trump to the White House and boosted Marine Le Pen''s popularity in France. "But dealing with a deficit means we must rethink our policies." Speaking as two Egyptian kitchen staff served tea and Arabic coffee, Al-Kandari said his beef isn''t with the guest workers who build skyscrapers, drive cabs or work in services. Kuwaitis don''t want those jobs anyway. But he doesn''t think foreigners should fill professional jobs like administrators and teachers when official unemployment among locals is 4.7 percent. Part of the issue is pay since migrant workers accept a fraction in wages. University-educated Kuwaitis earned a median of 1,350 dinars ($4,426) a month in 2015 versus 490 for similarly qualified expatriates, according to official statistics. The overall wage discrepancy was even starker: 1,113 dinars versus 120 dinars. A recent survey of several Kuwaiti nationals showed opinion is divided on the urgency of change. Khalid Bouaraki, a government employee, said compatriots upset over subsidy cuts are "overreacting" because they can afford it. Perks exclusive to citizens include free land plots to build homes, interest-free loans, university and marriage grants and the occasional state write-off of consumer debt. On the other hand, Yousef Mohamad, a 49-year old state employee, is suffering because his salary hasn''t gone up in years. "Not all of us are rich," the father of four said, while sipping tea in a local cafe. "Many of us are struggling to land secure jobs." Along with lowering its dependence on oil and modernizing infrastructure, Kuwait''s 2035 development plan envisions reducing the proportion of foreigners to 60 percent from the current 70 percent, according to local media. But appeasing dissidents like Al-Hashem, who wants businesses to take the burden from the state for funding benefits for foreigners, will take more than that. Since securing her seat, she''s won support for a bill to overturn the gasoline price increase, lobbied vigorously to make migrant workers buy medical insurance and proposed an expat-only road tax to ease traffic congestion. "I won''t remain silent just to keep our boat sailing," Al-Hashem said. "Citizens would be willing to pay their fair share, but not when they know their money will go to pay for the others."

For the first time, a joint research team consisting of public policy experts from RAND Corporation, Santa Monica; Rollins school of Public health, Atlanta and IIPH-Gandhinagar have prepared a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) map for Gujarat and 607 districts across the country as a tool to map population that is vulnerable to extreme heat. The index is a tool for planners to create ways of dealing with high climate pressures in urban and rural areas. The tribal district of Dahod, according to this index, is among the country''s eight most vulnerable districts in the country among 640 districts. The experts measured the lowest vulnerability at -11.8 and the highest at +9.4. The HVI was arrived at after analyzing each district''s demography, socio economic status, density of vegetation, land surface temperatures and availability of health systems for most vulnerable people — the poor, tribal, elderly, women and young and semi urban population. In Gujarat, too, most of the tribal and poor districts are rated high on the HVI. Principal investigator, Dr Gulrez Azhar, from RAND Corporation told TOI, "Our HVI shows that rural areas in Gujarat and across India have a higher HVI than urban areas.""Our heat action plans are presently urban biased. In countries like India where financial resources are scarce, health budgets should to be prioritized as per heat vulnerability. Heat is a silent and potent killer and there is a need for mapping HVI," Azar said. Azar had collaborated with researchers Shubhayu Saha , Dr Partha Ganguly , Dr Dileep Mavalankar, and Jaime Madrigano. Another problem Azar highlights is that health systems in Gujarat or India don''t record heatwave deaths separately for each district. "Countries like Bangladesh maintain a countrywide count of heatwave deaths," said Azhar, adding, "When exposed to heat and dry air, the brain, kidney and heart are first to get affected."', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 24, 2017, 07.58 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/heatwaves-need-more-attention-in-rural-areas/articleshow/58332546.cms', 'Times of India'),

The Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Saturday night arrested two persons carrying 16.3 kg gold valued at Rs 4.7 crore after they came out of the MG Road Metro station. In the last four days, more than 20 kg gold has been seized by central agencies from areas near Burrabazar. According to DRI sources, the duo — linked to a Bangladeshi gold smuggling racket — collected the metal from the Ranaghat area. They carried it to Kolkata and then allegedly boarded Metro at Dum Dum. They got down at MG Road and were heading towards a hotel at Burrabazar when DRI officials arrested them outside the station. Metro Railway authority, though, denied having any knowledge of the duo travelling on a train. While they had some clothes in bags, DRI officials found metallic substances tied around their waists. The duo had concealed gold biscuits in gamochas and tied it as belts around their waists. During interrogation, they revealed that they were supposed to hand it over to buyers at Burrabazar. Most of the gold biscuits had foreign markings on them. DRI sources said they had planned to check in a hotel at Burrabazar and hand over the metal to the buyers. Three days ago, Customs arrested a person from a Rabindra Sarani hotel with around 3 kg gold biscuits allegedly brought from Bangladesh. According to officials, the man was trying to hand over the gold biscuits to buyers in the Burrabazar area. "There has been a spike in demand for gold in Burrabazar and a lot of movement is being tracked.

This was the second time Jaitley raised the H-1B visa issue with the American side during his visit here to attend the annual Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He had also raised the issue with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier. During their meeting, Jaitley and Mnuchin discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, in addition to the international cooperation against terror financing. Jaitley highlighted the notable progress made in the India-US relations over the last few years and India''s ambitious reform agenda which was creating new opportunities towards a deeper economic engagement between the two countries, a Finance Ministry statement said. "Critical economic issues like India-US investment initiative, infrastructure collaboration and NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund), collaboration with the US for Smart Cities Development were deliberated upon during the meeting," it said. Jaitley raised the issue of H-1B visas for skilled professionals from India and highlighted the contribution which Indian companies and professionals are making to the US economy, the statement said. US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order for tightening the rules of the H-1B visa programme+ to stop its "abuse" and ensure that the visas are given to the "most-skilled or highest paid" petitioners, a decision that would impact India''s $150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concerns over this as these visas were mainly used by domestic IT professionals for short-term work in America. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. The US market accounts for about 60 per cent of the revenue of the Indian IT industry. Reforming the H-1B visa system was one of the major election promises of Trump. As per several US reports, a majority of the H-1B visas every year are grabbed by Indian IT professionals. India accounts for the highest pool of qualified IT professionals, whose services go a long way in making American companies globally competitive. Last month, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar had said that the Indian IT industry actually contributes immensely to the US economy in terms of jobs that are created in America, both directly and indirectly. "Close to half a million jobs have been supported in the US as of 2015. The number of jobs have also been growing at 10 per cent per year as against a two per cent growth in the rest of the job market," he had said. Issues related to terror funding were also discussed during Jaitley''s meeting with the US treasury secretary, who appreciated India''s role, including the India-US cooperation in Financial Action Task Force. Jaitley also held bilateral meetings with the finance ministers of Sweden, France and Bangladesh. The discussions covered a wide spectrum of bilateral collaboration to strengthen the cross-country relationships. He also held a bilateral meeting with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim among others. Meanwhile, Economic Affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das held bilateral meetings with New Development Bank (NDB) president KV Kamath and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) president Gilbert F Houngbo separately. Various policy issues regarding NDB and IFAD were discussed during the meeting.

But it also happened to be the first day of the new year in Bangladesh. So on that day, April 14, Jaya Ahsan stood on the cusp of two worlds — both equally Bengali, but different. That set the ball rolling for the conversation, from Satyajit Ray to Nurul Alam Atique, Humayun Ahmed to Sunil Ganguly. But as Jaya explained to us, the love and adulation she receives are the same on both sides. There is no colour or religion to it. Excerpts: This is the first time after many years that you''re away from Dhaka during Poila Boishakh. Aren''t you missing home? Don''t ask me about it. Ma has made all sorts of bhartas at home and she''s sending me photos. I don''t mind missing the religious occasions, which are big in Bangladesh. But the Mongol Shobhayatra that happens in Dhaka on Poila Boishakh is something else altogether. People go crazy at the carnival. They are drunk on the energy and joy of the celebrations. Even someone who earns 5,000 Taka will set aside something to celebrate this day. They will draw Bangladesh flags on their cheeks and go out. People buy colourful clothes — saris, lungi, gamchha — especially for kids. Kolkata has no such celebrations for Poila Boishakh. What are your plans? Friends have called me over for lunch, some of them want to bring over home-cooked food to my place. But I will also have to go for hall visits, because Bishorjon has just released.

Talking about our shared cultural heritage — West Bengal and Bangladesh — do you think there is a greater sense of pride and joy in being Bengali and speaking Bangla on that side of the border than here? In Bangladesh, people are more emotional. People in Kolkata also love their language, but yes, there are some things that irritate me. Let''s say I go to a hospital to see a doctor. They can see from my passport and my clothes that I''m Bengali. The person at the counter is also Bengali, I can see that on his name tag. But they immediately start speaking in English. I find this attitude very difficult to understand. Why would one Bengali person speak to another in English? In Bangladesh too we have this tribe who love to speak in, what we call, Banglish. They roll their ''R''s and have a different attitude. It is sad, really. Being someone from the entertainment industry, do you find people in Bengal as aware about the cinema, music and literature of Bangladesh as people there are about the art and culture in West Bengal? Oh no, I think people on this side of the border are much deprived. You have Sunil, Sirshendu and others here, but our literature is of great calibre, whether it is Shahduzzaman, Ilias, or senior writers like Humayun Ahmed and Hasan Azizul Huq. For example, Huq''s stories have subtexts and layers that reveal themselves only when you read between the lines of the written text. I''ve done Rajkahini on Partition, but let me tell you about Khancha, a film on Partition that I''ve done in Bangladesh. It''s about the stories of families trapped on both sides of the border, thinking that all their problems will get solved once they are able to cross over. It is a remarkable film and these stories need to be told. People here are missing them. What about the films that you''ve done in Tollywood? Have they been creatively fulfilling? See, there are problems on both sides, and we artistes are caught in the middle. We are always searching for good characters and storytelling. But in Tollywood, there is a lot of fear among directors. Sahosh ta kom. But the industry provides such great infrastructure and organisation. All departments have separate roles and everyone knows their job. Even after getting so much in terms of facilities, if one does not make something dynamic, then it is a matter of great sadness. In Bangladesh, there is not much infrastructure, but a lot of passion. At times, even the entire production budget has not been organised, but the director is like cholo, let''s start shooting. Since I''m greedy for good roles, I too get swayed by the passion, and you''ll probably find me in some remote part of the country, where there isn''t even proper drinking water, shooting for the film. There is a sense of madness and joy. Filmmakers may not understand the managerial aspect of it, but there is a sense of honesty you can glimpse in the films there. I don''t find that honesty here. In Tollywood, things are done mathematically, based mostly on audience perception. The thinking is narrow. Which is why, since Satyajit Ray, hardly any films have travelled to the big festivals. But in Bangladesh, a host of independent directors is doing cutting-edge work. Take the example of Abdullah Mohd Saad. He''s a young director, who''s made Live From Dhaka, which has made a big splash at international festivals. It''s about a physically challenged man who wants to leave behind the life of Dhaka. What about roles you get here and in Bangladesh? What are the differences? They trust me there with interesting female roles. Maybe it''s because I do mostly independent films and that too not very frequently. In Bengal, directors love to play safe. Women in Tollywood films are mostly very feminine; that''s the way they''re designed. The thinking is on a small scale. In Bangladesh, I''ve just done a film on life in a circus. From walking a tightrope to doing stunts, I''ve not taken a body double. Where are roles like that for women here? I also did Peyarar Subash with Nurul Alam Atique. He lives the life of a filmmaker. One doesn''t become a filmmaker only my making films. You have to live that life. Like Indranil Roychowdhury here, I want to work with him again and again. The problem in Tollywood is that they will only shoot as much as they''ve planned and never go beyond that. Even if interesting things come up, they won''t go by impulse. At times, I''m itching to suggest something, but I know it is of no use and hold myself back. In Bangladesh, the madness is much more. There is still a hangover of Ritwik Ghatak there, much more than Satyajit Ray. Even I''m a bigger fan of Ghatak. He felt the pain of Partition and carried it in his heart to India. That pain is there in his works. Rajkahini, Bishorjon — you''re constantly working on films where the border is a motif. As a Bangladeshi working in India, how do you react to that? I''m the biggest sufferer in that respect. I have to come with a passport to this country to meet my friends and work with them. People have welcomed me here, but there are troubles at the bureaucratic level. In Bangladesh, people are very possessive about me, and their emotions run to extremes. When they love me, it is with all their hearts. When they want to throw me away, that, too, they do with full force. But at the end of the day, I''m an artiste and I''ll work wherever I get the chance. The other thing that irritates me is that when Shakib Al Hasan plays here, there is a great sense of pride in Bangladesh. But when Jaya Ahsan works in India, many people can''t take it. I honestly think there is a gender issue at work here. This is a busy year for you. You have a lot of releases lined up on that side of the border. Yes, that''s true. But my biggest challenge this year is that I have also pitched myself as a producer. I''ve got a government subsidy to make a film based on Humayun Ahmed''s story, Debi. I''ve got the government funds, but I have to gather the rest of the money and finish the film within time. The shooting is going on. This is a story from the Misir Ali series. Chanchal Choudhury, who had a role in Moner Manush, play Misir Ali. When you get roles here, do you see a tendency to offer you characters that speak a Bangladeshi dialect? Does that act as a limitation? (Pauses) I don''t feel any limitation from my side. If I get cast as a person with a Purba Bangla background, that''s because those roles have been written in that manner. Srijit told me there was a character from that background in Rajkahini. Kaushikda had written the story of Bishorjon a long time back, but after meeting me, the idea became more concrete. As for me, I''ve always liked stories about marginalised people. That''s not to say I can''t play urban characters, but that''s not my first choice. I wouldn''t want mind roles about adivasi people, or people from far-flung areas in India. I''m confident of taking up that challenge. What is the point of doing characters that are just like me in real life? Among the directors you''ve worked with in India, with whom have you got the most creative satisfaction? Indranil Roychowdhury, definitely. Also Kaushik Ganguly. If you talk about being organised, then Arindam Sil. He can see the whole film from beforehand. He also listens to artistes and gives me a lot of liberty, something that say, Srijit, does not. There is understanding between Arindamda and me, probably because he made his first film with me. It''s the same with Indranil. What about the co-actors you''ve worked with? Definitely Kaushikda. Also Sohini, since I feel very comfortable with her. I like working with Abir; we''ve done quite a few films together and there''s a tuning we share. I''ve not worked with Ritwick Chakraborty, but I''ve heard so much about him. Most others here are always trying to act well. But I don''t even want to act! That is my challenge. I like working with unpredictable actors, even non-actors. You have a huge fan following on both sides of the border. When your name is linked to co-actors, how do you react? It''s irritating. I don''t understand all this talk about image. My biggest trip is my work, if I get that I''m happy. The entertainment industry is a unique space. There is a lot of dirt and muck. You have to live with that; it comes with the package. But your life should be like a swan''s. When you rise up, the dirt should fall away so that you can soar above it all, free and unblemished.', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 23, 2017, 11.26 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/in-tollywood-directors-are-scared-to-take-too-many-risks-jaya-ahsan/articleshow/58324191.cms', 'Times of India'),

However, what he originally planned was a medical career. He had been running his own hospital for over a decade. With time, he observed a steep rise in the number of people contracting chronic diseases at a relatively young age. "Earlier, I did not get many cases related to the heart, breathing and cancer. But over the last three to four years, I started receiving cases of 22 to 23 year old youths with heart disease and cancer. The number of people with asthma is also on the rise. So I decided to promote healthy living," he said. Dr Phaden swears by the benefits of cycling. "Even if you do cycling five times a week, for just half an hour, it reduces the chance of getting a heart attack by 30%," he said. Lately, his journey took him to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where he organised a number of seminars, camps and cycle rallies. "The reception I got there was overwhelming. They appreciate the fact that someone from outside has come to teach them about the environment. It feels nice to work with people who want to bring about a change," he said. Before setting out to cover the world, Dr Raj was amazed at the polarities he witnessed in different parts of the country.

For the first time, a joint research team consisting of public policy experts from RAND Corporation, Santa Monica; Rollins school of Public health, Atlanta and IIPH-Gandhinagar have prepared a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) map for Gujarat and 607 districts across the country as a tool to map population that is vulnerable to extreme heat. The index is a tool for planners to create ways of dealing with high climate pressures in urban and rural areas. The tribal district of Dahod, according to this index, is among the country''s eight most vulnerable districts in the country among 640 districts. The experts measured the lowest vulnerability at -11.8 and the highest at +9.4. The HVI was arrived at after analyzing each district''s demography, socio economic status, density of vegetation, land surface temperatures and availability of health systems for most vulnerable people — the poor, tribal, elderly, women and young and semi urban population. In Gujarat, too, most of the tribal and poor districts are rated high on the HVI. Principal investigator, Dr Gulrez Azhar, from RAND Corporation told TOI, "Our HVI shows that rural areas in Gujarat and across India have a higher HVI than urban areas.""Our heat action plans are presently urban biased. In countries like India where financial resources are scarce, health budgets should to be prioritized as per heat vulnerability. Heat is a silent and potent killer and there is a need for mapping HVI," Azar said. Azar had collaborated with researchers Shubhayu Saha , Dr Partha Ganguly , Dr Dileep Mavalankar, and Jaime Madrigano. Another problem Azar highlights is that health systems in Gujarat or India don''t record heatwave deaths separately for each district.

In the last four days, more than 20 kg gold has been seized by central agencies from areas near Burrabazar. According to DRI sources, the duo — linked to a Bangladeshi gold smuggling racket — collected the metal from the Ranaghat area. They carried it to Kolkata and then allegedly boarded Metro at Dum Dum. They got down at MG Road and were heading towards a hotel at Burrabazar when DRI officials arrested them outside the station. Metro Railway authority, though, denied having any knowledge of the duo travelling on a train. While they had some clothes in bags, DRI officials found metallic substances tied around their waists. The duo had concealed gold biscuits in gamochas and tied it as belts around their waists. During interrogation, they revealed that they were supposed to hand it over to buyers at Burrabazar. Most of the gold biscuits had foreign markings on them. DRI sources said they had planned to check in a hotel at Burrabazar and hand over the metal to the buyers.

This was the second time Jaitley raised the H-1B visa issue with the American side during his visit here to attend the annual Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He had also raised the issue with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier. During their meeting, Jaitley and Mnuchin discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, in addition to the international cooperation against terror financing. Jaitley highlighted the notable progress made in the India-US relations over the last few years and India''s ambitious reform agenda which was creating new opportunities towards a deeper economic engagement between the two countries, a Finance Ministry statement said. "Critical economic issues like India-US investment initiative, infrastructure collaboration and NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund), collaboration with the US for Smart Cities Development were deliberated upon during the meeting," it said. Jaitley raised the issue of H-1B visas for skilled professionals from India and highlighted the contribution which Indian companies and professionals are making to the US economy, the statement said. US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order for tightening the rules of the H-1B visa programme+ to stop its "abuse" and ensure that the visas are given to the "most-skilled or highest paid" petitioners, a decision that would impact India''s $150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concerns over this as these visas were mainly used by domestic IT professionals for short-term work in America. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. The US market accounts for about 60 per cent of the revenue of the Indian IT industry. Reforming the H-1B visa system was one of the major election promises of Trump. As per several US reports, a majority of the H-1B visas every year are grabbed by Indian IT professionals. India accounts for the highest pool of qualified IT professionals, whose services go a long way in making American companies globally competitive. Last month, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar had said that the Indian IT industry actually contributes immensely to the US economy in terms of jobs that are created in America, both directly and indirectly. "Close to half a million jobs have been supported in the US as of 2015. The number of jobs have also been growing at 10 per cent per year as against a two per cent growth in the rest of the job market," he had said.

Talking about our shared cultural heritage — West Bengal and Bangladesh — do you think there is a greater sense of pride and joy in being Bengali and speaking Bangla on that side of the border than here? In Bangladesh, people are more emotional. People in Kolkata also love their language, but yes, there are some things that irritate me. Let''s say I go to a hospital to see a doctor. They can see from my passport and my clothes that I''m Bengali. The person at the counter is also Bengali, I can see that on his name tag. But they immediately start speaking in English. I find this attitude very difficult to understand. Why would one Bengali person speak to another in English? In Bangladesh too we have this tribe who love to speak in, what we call, Banglish. They roll their ''R''s and have a different attitude. It is sad, really. Being someone from the entertainment industry, do you find people in Bengal as aware about the cinema, music and literature of Bangladesh as people there are about the art and culture in West Bengal? Oh no, I think people on this side of the border are much deprived. You have Sunil, Sirshendu and others here, but our literature is of great calibre, whether it is Shahduzzaman, Ilias, or senior writers like Humayun Ahmed and Hasan Azizul Huq. For example, Huq''s stories have subtexts and layers that reveal themselves only when you read between the lines of the written text. I''ve done Rajkahini on Partition, but let me tell you about Khancha, a film on Partition that I''ve done in Bangladesh. It''s about the stories of families trapped on both sides of the border, thinking that all their problems will get solved once they are able to cross over. It is a remarkable film and these stories need to be told. People here are missing them. What about the films that you''ve done in Tollywood? Have they been creatively fulfilling? See, there are problems on both sides, and we artistes are caught in the middle. We are always searching for good characters and storytelling. But in Tollywood, there is a lot of fear among directors. Sahosh ta kom. But the industry provides such great infrastructure and organisation. All departments have separate roles and everyone knows their job. Even after getting so much in terms of facilities, if one does not make something dynamic, then it is a matter of great sadness. In Bangladesh, there is not much infrastructure, but a lot of passion. At times, even the entire production budget has not been organised, but the director is like cholo, let''s start shooting. Since I''m greedy for good roles, I too get swayed by the passion, and you''ll probably find me in some remote part of the country, where there isn''t even proper drinking water, shooting for the film. There is a sense of madness and joy. Filmmakers may not understand the managerial aspect of it, but there is a sense of honesty you can glimpse in the films there. I don''t find that honesty here. In Tollywood, things are done mathematically, based mostly on audience perception. The thinking is narrow. Which is why, since Satyajit Ray, hardly any films have travelled to the big festivals. But in Bangladesh, a host of independent directors is doing cutting-edge work. Take the example of Abdullah Mohd Saad. He''s a young director, who''s made Live From Dhaka, which has made a big splash at international festivals. It''s about a physically challenged man who wants to leave behind the life of Dhaka. What about roles you get here and in Bangladesh? What are the differences? They trust me there with interesting female roles. Maybe it''s because I do mostly independent films and that too not very frequently. In Bengal, directors love to play safe. Women in Tollywood films are mostly very feminine; that''s the way they''re designed. The thinking is on a small scale. In Bangladesh, I''ve just done a film on life in a circus. From walking a tightrope to doing stunts, I''ve not taken a body double. Where are roles like that for women here? I also did Peyarar Subash with Nurul Alam Atique. He lives the life of a filmmaker. One doesn''t become a filmmaker only my making films. You have to live that life. Like Indranil Roychowdhury here, I want to work with him again and again. The problem in Tollywood is that they will only shoot as much as they''ve planned and never go beyond that. Even if interesting things come up, they won''t go by impulse. At times, I''m itching to suggest something, but I know it is of no use and hold myself back. In Bangladesh, the madness is much more. There is still a hangover of Ritwik Ghatak there, much more than Satyajit Ray. Even I''m a bigger fan of Ghatak. He felt the pain of Partition and carried it in his heart to India. That pain is there in his works. Rajkahini, Bishorjon — you''re constantly working on films where the border is a motif. As a Bangladeshi working in India, how do you react to that? I''m the biggest sufferer in that respect. I have to come with a passport to this country to meet my friends and work with them. People have welcomed me here, but there are troubles at the bureaucratic level. In Bangladesh, people are very possessive about me, and their emotions run to extremes. When they love me, it is with all their hearts. When they want to throw me away, that, too, they do with full force. But at the end of the day, I''m an artiste and I''ll work wherever I get the chance. The other thing that irritates me is that when Shakib Al Hasan plays here, there is a great sense of pride in Bangladesh. But when Jaya Ahsan works in India, many people can''t take it. I honestly think there is a gender issue at work here. This is a busy year for you. You have a lot of releases lined up on that side of the border. Yes, that''s true. But my biggest challenge this year is that I have also pitched myself as a producer. I''ve got a government subsidy to make a film based on Humayun Ahmed''s story, Debi. I''ve got the government funds, but I have to gather the rest of the money and finish the film within time. The shooting is going on. This is a story from the Misir Ali series. Chanchal Choudhury, who had a role in Moner Manush, play Misir Ali. When you get roles here, do you see a tendency to offer you characters that speak a Bangladeshi dialect? Does that act as a limitation? (Pauses) I don''t feel any limitation from my side. If I get cast as a person with a Purba Bangla background, that''s because those roles have been written in that manner. Srijit told me there was a character from that background in Rajkahini. Kaushikda had written the story of Bishorjon a long time back, but after meeting me, the idea became more concrete. As for me, I''ve always liked stories about marginalised people. That''s not to say I can''t play urban characters, but that''s not my first choice. I wouldn''t want mind roles about adivasi people, or people from far-flung areas in India. I''m confident of taking up that challenge. What is the point of doing characters that are just like me in real life? Among the directors you''ve worked with in India, with whom have you got the most creative satisfaction? Indranil Roychowdhury, definitely. Also Kaushik Ganguly. If you talk about being organised, then Arindam Sil. He can see the whole film from beforehand. He also listens to artistes and gives me a lot of liberty, something that say, Srijit, does not. There is understanding between Arindamda and me, probably because he made his first film with me. It''s the same with Indranil. What about the co-actors you''ve worked with? Definitely Kaushikda. Also Sohini, since I feel very comfortable with her. I like working with Abir; we''ve done quite a few films together and there''s a tuning we share. I''ve not worked with Ritwick Chakraborty, but I''ve heard so much about him. Most others here are always trying to act well. But I don''t even want to act! That is my challenge. I like working with unpredictable actors, even non-actors. You have a huge fan following on both sides of the border. When your name is linked to co-actors, how do you react? It''s irritating. I don''t understand all this talk about image. My biggest trip is my work, if I get that I''m happy. The entertainment industry is a unique space. There is a lot of dirt and muck. You have to live with that; it comes with the package. But your life should be like a swan''s. When you rise up, the dirt should fall away so that you can soar above it all, free and unblemished.', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 23, 2017, 11.26 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/in-tollywood-directors-are-scared-to-take-too-many-risks-jaya-ahsan/articleshow/58324191.cms', 'Times of India');

He is trying to accomplish this by cycling around the world and has covered Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Africa so far. However, what he originally planned was a medical career. He had been running his own hospital for over a decade. With time, he observed a steep rise in the number of people contracting chronic diseases at a relatively young age. "Earlier, I did not get many cases related to the heart, breathing and cancer. But over the last three to four years, I started receiving cases of 22 to 23 year old youths with heart disease and cancer. The number of people with asthma is also on the rise. So I decided to promote healthy living," he said. Dr Phaden swears by the benefits of cycling. "Even if you do cycling five times a week, for just half an hour, it reduces the chance of getting a heart attack by 30%," he said. Lately, his journey took him to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where he organised a number of seminars, camps and cycle rallies. "The reception I got there was overwhelming. They appreciate the fact that someone from outside has come to teach them about the environment. It feels nice to work with people who want to bring about a change," he said. Before setting out to cover the world, Dr Raj was amazed at the polarities he witnessed in different parts of the country. "Awareness levels are pathetic in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while Sikkim and Mizoram show a high degree of awareness and responsibility towards the environment. People over there live in harmony with nature," he said. Dr Raj has organised more than 25 cycle rallies in various states. However, he says a token of acknowledgement from the Centre or Haryana government would help him tide over diplomatic hurdles.', '| TNN | Apr 23, 2017, 10.18 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/this-doctor-is-out-to-heal-the-planet/articleshow/58323663.cms', 'Times of India'),

UP may take triple talaq victims into shelter homes The UP government has taken note of the demand from Muslim organisations campaigning against triple talaq to use Waqf property for creating shelter homes for women victims of the controversial practice. All India Women Muslim Personal Law Board chairperson Shaista Amber had given a proposal to state minister for women and children, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, earlier this week that shelter homes for women should be constructed on Waqf properties. While confirming this, Joshi, however, said it was yet to be discussed properly. "The ambit of this (shelter homes) scheme is being widened.

"In this context coming together in BIMSTEC is truly important. We already saw earlier SAARC with all our high hopes has not done much, and for the moment it is doubtful whether or not the next summit meeting will happen," International Affairs Adviser Gowher Rizvi said at the opening of the BIMSTEC Network of Policy Think Tanks (BNPTT) meeting here at the Bay of Bengal grouping''s headquarters. He said Bangladesh hopes to make up through sub-regional cooperation including BIMSTEC after the failure of SAARC, bdnews24.com reported. "We have seen NAFTA may or may not survive. We see European Union under challenge. In Bangladesh we see much of the future in the sub-region. It is the sub-region we are focused on. We have BBIN, BCIM and BIMSTEC... this is where we see our future," Rizvi said, giving examples of the state of the regional groupings in the world. The seven countries'' grouping BIMSTEC connecting South Asia with the Southeast Asia received much attention after the last year''s SAARC summit in Islamabad was postponed following tensions between India and Pakistan over terror attacks, the report said. Some think tanks consider BIMSTEC as an alternative to SAARC as Pakistan is not part of this grouping, it said. India''s Research and Information System for Developing Countries, Bangladesh''s Centre for Policy Dialogue, Bhutan''s Royal Institute for Governance and Strategic Studies, Myanmar Institute of Strategic and International Studies, Nepal''s Centre for Economic Development and Administration, Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka and Thailand''s Indian Studies Centre of Chulalongkorn University are the members of the BNPTT which was formed at the second summit in November 2008. The grouping is promoting 14 priority sectors of development and common concerns including trade and investment, transport and communication, tourism and people- to-people contact. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted BIMSTEC leaders in Goa last year during the BRICS summit. Hasina had attended the meeting. BIMSTEC Secretary General Sumith Nakandala said their intention was to help the BIMSTEC think tank network "effectively carry out duties for policy advocacy in all 14 priority areas". Rizvi thanked the secretary general for "truly revitalising BIMSTEC and giving it extraordinary sense of direction and energy", the report said. He also urged the think tanks to come up with big ideas that "excite leaders to action and give them vision".

(39, 'MI v RPS, IPL 2017: Mumbai Indians face resurgent Rising Pune Supergiant', 'MUMBAI: Be it good or bad, every cricketer has a relationship with certain venues. On certain grounds, batsmen and bowlers either appear mortal, or become supermen. And, there are certain venues that play an important role in your evolution as a cricketer. The Wankhede Stadium has been one such venue for former India and Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) captain and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni. He will be in the spotlight again as the Steve Smith-led RPS (3 wins, 6 games, 6 points) take on hosts and tabletoppers Mumbai Indians (6 wins, 7 games, 12 points) in match 28 of the IPL. It was here in early 2005 that Dhoni, after an uncertain and unimpressive start to his India career in Bangladesh, took corrective steps and not just cemented his spot, but went on to become a legend. Batting for East Zone, led by current selector Debang Gandhi, he belted 101 off 102 balls as opener with 11 fours and two sixes. Dhoni was the lone shining light for his team as they went down to West Zone by 63 runs. After the game, he had a long chat with the media while sitting on the turf and even shared his telephone number. "Yaad rakhna bhai log," he pleaded with reporters flashing a disarming smile. That knock earned him a ticket for the Challenger Trophy, where he represented India Seniors, led by Sourav Ganguly. He opened again in the tournament, hosted at Wankhede, and got another hundred, a 96-ball unbeaten 102, against India B to take them to the final. The debate for the keeper-batsman''s slot for the ODI series against Pakistan was settled for good. His performances since settled that debate forever. The relationship with Wankhede though continued as the throbbing stadium welcomed Dhoni with open arms after the victory parade to celebrate India''s inaugural World T20 victory in 2007 on a rain-drenched September afternoon. And it was Mumbai''s Big W, where he hit that famous six against Sri Lanka on a balmy April 2 night, to help India clinch the 2011 World Cup. Since then though that relationship has witnessed turbulence. On a made-to-order pitch, Dhoni''s India lost to England in 2012 in a Test match here.', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 24, 2017, 10.48 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/mi-v-rps-ipl-2017-mumbai-indians-face-resurgent-rising-pune-supergiant/articleshow/58336936.cms', 'Times of India');

For the first time, a joint research team consisting of public policy experts from RAND Corporation, Santa Monica; Rollins school of Public health, Atlanta and IIPH-Gandhinagar have prepared a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) map for Gujarat and 607 districts across the country as a tool to map population that is vulnerable to extreme heat. The index is a tool for planners to create ways of dealing with high climate pressures in urban and rural areas. The tribal district of Dahod, according to this index, is among the country''s eight most vulnerable districts in the country among 640 districts. The experts measured the lowest vulnerability at -11.8 and the highest at +9.4. The HVI was arrived at after analyzing each district''s demography, socio economic status, density of vegetation, land surface temperatures and availability of health systems for most vulnerable people — the poor, tribal, elderly, women and young and semi urban population. In Gujarat, too, most of the tribal and poor districts are rated high on the HVI. Principal investigator, Dr Gulrez Azhar, from RAND Corporation told TOI, "Our HVI shows that rural areas in Gujarat and across India have a higher HVI than urban areas.""Our heat action plans are presently urban biased. In countries like India where financial resources are scarce, health budgets should to be prioritized as per heat vulnerability. Heat is a silent and potent killer and there is a need for mapping HVI," Azar said. Azar had collaborated with researchers Shubhayu Saha , Dr Partha Ganguly , Dr Dileep Mavalankar, and Jaime Madrigano. Another problem Azar highlights is that health systems in Gujarat or India don''t record heatwave deaths separately for each district. "Countries like Bangladesh maintain a countrywide count of heatwave deaths," said Azhar, adding, "When exposed to heat and dry air, the brain, kidney and heart are first to get affected."', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 24, 2017, 07.58 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/heatwaves-need-more-attention-in-rural-areas/articleshow/58332546.cms', 'Times of India'),

The Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Saturday night arrested two persons carrying 16.3 kg gold valued at Rs 4.7 crore after they came out of the MG Road Metro station. In the last four days, more than 20 kg gold has been seized by central agencies from areas near Burrabazar. According to DRI sources, the duo — linked to a Bangladeshi gold smuggling racket — collected the metal from the Ranaghat area. They carried it to Kolkata and then allegedly boarded Metro at Dum Dum. They got down at MG Road and were heading towards a hotel at Burrabazar when DRI officials arrested them outside the station. Metro Railway authority, though, denied having any knowledge of the duo travelling on a train. While they had some clothes in bags, DRI officials found metallic substances tied around their waists. The duo had concealed gold biscuits in gamochas and tied it as belts around their waists. During interrogation, they revealed that they were supposed to hand it over to buyers at Burrabazar. Most of the gold biscuits had foreign markings on them. DRI sources said they had planned to check in a hotel at Burrabazar and hand over the metal to the buyers. Three days ago, Customs arrested a person from a Rabindra Sarani hotel with around 3 kg gold biscuits allegedly brought from Bangladesh. According to officials, the man was trying to hand over the gold biscuits to buyers in the Burrabazar area. "There has been a spike in demand for gold in Burrabazar and a lot of movement is being tracked. Some of the bullion traders are buying the illegal gold in bulk and sending it across the states," said a Customs official. Illegal trading of gold has seen a huge spurt at Burrabazar after the demonetisation. Prices of the yellow metal in grey market increased by 70%-80% owing to huge demand. Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate conducted raids in the area for months and the illegal trade in Burrabazar "sonapatty" started ebbing out. While the lull continued for first three months of the year, it started picking up since March-end. According to I-T officials, there is a section that''s trying to repatriate black money stashed outside after the demonetisation drive.', 'TNN | Apr 24, 2017, 05.47 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/illegal-gold-trade-picks-pace-2-held-with-rs-4-7-crore-metal/articleshow/58332809.cms', 'Times of India'),

This was the second time Jaitley raised the H-1B visa issue with the American side during his visit here to attend the annual Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He had also raised the issue with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier. During their meeting, Jaitley and Mnuchin discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, in addition to the international cooperation against terror financing. Jaitley highlighted the notable progress made in the India-US relations over the last few years and India''s ambitious reform agenda which was creating new opportunities towards a deeper economic engagement between the two countries, a Finance Ministry statement said. "Critical economic issues like India-US investment initiative, infrastructure collaboration and NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund), collaboration with the US for Smart Cities Development were deliberated upon during the meeting," it said. Jaitley raised the issue of H-1B visas for skilled professionals from India and highlighted the contribution which Indian companies and professionals are making to the US economy, the statement said. US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order for tightening the rules of the H-1B visa programme+ to stop its "abuse" and ensure that the visas are given to the "most-skilled or highest paid" petitioners, a decision that would impact India''s $150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concerns over this as these visas were mainly used by domestic IT professionals for short-term work in America. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. The US market accounts for about 60 per cent of the revenue of the Indian IT industry. Reforming the H-1B visa system was one of the major election promises of Trump. As per several US reports, a majority of the H-1B visas every year are grabbed by Indian IT professionals. India accounts for the highest pool of qualified IT professionals, whose services go a long way in making American companies globally competitive. Last month, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar had said that the Indian IT industry actually contributes immensely to the US economy in terms of jobs that are created in America, both directly and indirectly. "Close to half a million jobs have been supported in the US as of 2015. The number of jobs have also been growing at 10 per cent per year as against a two per cent growth in the rest of the job market," he had said. Issues related to terror funding were also discussed during Jaitley''s meeting with the US treasury secretary, who appreciated India''s role, including the India-US cooperation in Financial Action Task Force. Jaitley also held bilateral meetings with the finance ministers of Sweden, France and Bangladesh. The discussions covered a wide spectrum of bilateral collaboration to strengthen the cross-country relationships. He also held a bilateral meeting with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim among others. Meanwhile, Economic Affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das held bilateral meetings with New Development Bank (NDB) president KV Kamath and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) president Gilbert F Houngbo separately. Various policy issues regarding NDB and IFAD were discussed during the meeting.

(43, 'In tollywood, directors are scared to take too many risks: Jaya Ahsan', 'She walked into our office on the day before Poila Boishakh in Bengal. But it also happened to be the first day of the new year in Bangladesh. So on that day, April 14, Jaya Ahsan stood on the cusp of two worlds — both equally Bengali, but different. That set the ball rolling for the conversation, from Satyajit Ray to Nurul Alam Atique, Humayun Ahmed to Sunil Ganguly. But as Jaya explained to us, the love and adulation she receives are the same on both sides. There is no colour or religion to it. Excerpts: This is the first time after many years that you''re away from Dhaka during Poila Boishakh. Aren''t you missing home? Don''t ask me about it. Ma has made all sorts of bhartas at home and she''s sending me photos. I don''t mind missing the religious occasions, which are big in Bangladesh. But the Mongol Shobhayatra that happens in Dhaka on Poila Boishakh is something else altogether. People go crazy at the carnival. They are drunk on the energy and joy of the celebrations. Even someone who earns 5,000 Taka will set aside something to celebrate this day. They will draw Bangladesh flags on their cheeks and go out. People buy colourful clothes — saris, lungi, gamchha — especially for kids. Kolkata has no such celebrations for Poila Boishakh. What are your plans? Friends have called me over for lunch, some of them want to bring over home-cooked food to my place. But I will also have to go for hall visits, because Bishorjon has just released. So it''s more of a working Poila Boishakh for me (smiles)! Talking about our shared cultural heritage — West Bengal and Bangladesh — do you think there is a greater sense of pride and joy in being Bengali and speaking Bangla on that side of the border than here? In Bangladesh, people are more emotional. People in Kolkata also love their language, but yes, there are some things that irritate me. Let''s say I go to a hospital to see a doctor. They can see from my passport and my clothes that I''m Bengali. The person at the counter is also Bengali, I can see that on his name tag. But they immediately start speaking in English. I find this attitude very difficult to understand. Why would one Bengali person speak to another in English? In Bangladesh too we have this tribe who love to speak in, what we call, Banglish. They roll their ''R''s and have a different attitude. It is sad, really. Being someone from the entertainment industry, do you find people in Bengal as aware about the cinema, music and literature of Bangladesh as people there are about the art and culture in West Bengal? Oh no, I think people on this side of the border are much deprived. You have Sunil, Sirshendu and others here, but our literature is of great calibre, whether it is Shahduzzaman, Ilias, or senior writers like Humayun Ahmed and Hasan Azizul Huq. For example, Huq''s stories have subtexts and layers that reveal themselves only when you read between the lines of the written text. I''ve done Rajkahini on Partition, but let me tell you about Khancha, a film on Partition that I''ve done in Bangladesh. It''s about the stories of families trapped on both sides of the border, thinking that all their problems will get solved once they are able to cross over. It is a remarkable film and these stories need to be told. People here are missing them. What about the films that you''ve done in Tollywood? Have they been creatively fulfilling? See, there are problems on both sides, and we artistes are caught in the middle. We are always searching for good characters and storytelling. But in Tollywood, there is a lot of fear among directors. Sahosh ta kom. But the industry provides such great infrastructure and organisation. All departments have separate roles and everyone knows their job. Even after getting so much in terms of facilities, if one does not make something dynamic, then it is a matter of great sadness. In Bangladesh, there is not much infrastructure, but a lot of passion. At times, even the entire production budget has not been organised, but the director is like cholo, let''s start shooting. Since I''m greedy for good roles, I too get swayed by the passion, and you''ll probably find me in some remote part of the country, where there isn''t even proper drinking water, shooting for the film. There is a sense of madness and joy. Filmmakers may not understand the managerial aspect of it, but there is a sense of honesty you can glimpse in the films there. I don''t find that honesty here. In Tollywood, things are done mathematically, based mostly on audience perception. The thinking is narrow. Which is why, since Satyajit Ray, hardly any films have travelled to the big festivals. But in Bangladesh, a host of independent directors is doing cutting-edge work. Take the example of Abdullah Mohd Saad. He''s a young director, who''s made Live From Dhaka, which has made a big splash at international festivals. It''s about a physically challenged man who wants to leave behind the life of Dhaka. What about roles you get here and in Bangladesh? What are the differences? They trust me there with interesting female roles. Maybe it''s because I do mostly independent films and that too not very frequently. In Bengal, directors love to play safe. Women in Tollywood films are mostly very feminine; that''s the way they''re designed. The thinking is on a small scale. In Bangladesh, I''ve just done a film on life in a circus. From walking a tightrope to doing stunts, I''ve not taken a body double. Where are roles like that for women here? I also did Peyarar Subash with Nurul Alam Atique. He lives the life of a filmmaker. One doesn''t become a filmmaker only my making films. You have to live that life. Like Indranil Roychowdhury here, I want to work with him again and again. The problem in Tollywood is that they will only shoot as much as they''ve planned and never go beyond that. Even if interesting things come up, they won''t go by impulse. At times, I''m itching to suggest something, but I know it is of no use and hold myself back. In Bangladesh, the madness is much more. There is still a hangover of Ritwik Ghatak there, much more than Satyajit Ray. Even I''m a bigger fan of Ghatak. He felt the pain of Partition and carried it in his heart to India. That pain is there in his works. Rajkahini, Bishorjon — you''re constantly working on films where the border is a motif. As a Bangladeshi working in India, how do you react to that? I''m the biggest sufferer in that respect. I have to come with a passport to this country to meet my friends and work with them. People have welcomed me here, but there are troubles at the bureaucratic level. In Bangladesh, people are very possessive about me, and their emotions run to extremes. When they love me, it is with all their hearts. When they want to throw me away, that, too, they do with full force. But at the end of the day, I''m an artiste and I''ll work wherever I get the chance. The other thing that irritates me is that when Shakib Al Hasan plays here, there is a great sense of pride in Bangladesh. But when Jaya Ahsan works in India, many people can''t take it. I honestly think there is a gender issue at work here. This is a busy year for you. You have a lot of releases lined up on that side of the border. Yes, that''s true. But my biggest challenge this year is that I have also pitched myself as a producer. I''ve got a government subsidy to make a film based on Humayun Ahmed''s story, Debi. I''ve got the government funds, but I have to gather the rest of the money and finish the film within time. The shooting is going on. This is a story from the Misir Ali series. Chanchal Choudhury, who had a role in Moner Manush, play Misir Ali. When you get roles here, do you see a tendency to offer you characters that speak a Bangladeshi dialect? Does that act as a limitation? (Pauses) I don''t feel any limitation from my side. If I get cast as a person with a Purba Bangla background, that''s because those roles have been written in that manner. Srijit told me there was a character from that background in Rajkahini. Kaushikda had written the story of Bishorjon a long time back, but after meeting me, the idea became more concrete. As for me, I''ve always liked stories about marginalised people. That''s not to say I can''t play urban characters, but that''s not my first choice. I wouldn''t want mind roles about adivasi people, or people from far-flung areas in India. I''m confident of taking up that challenge. What is the point of doing characters that are just like me in real life? Among the directors you''ve worked with in India, with whom have you got the most creative satisfaction? Indranil Roychowdhury, definitely. Also Kaushik Ganguly. If you talk about being organised, then Arindam Sil. He can see the whole film from beforehand. He also listens to artistes and gives me a lot of liberty, something that say, Srijit, does not. There is understanding between Arindamda and me, probably because he made his first film with me. It''s the same with Indranil. What about the co-actors you''ve worked with? Definitely Kaushikda. Also Sohini, since I feel very comfortable with her. I like working with Abir; we''ve done quite a few films together and there''s a tuning we share. I''ve not worked with Ritwick Chakraborty, but I''ve heard so much about him. Most others here are always trying to act well. But I don''t even want to act! That is my challenge. I like working with unpredictable actors, even non-actors. You have a huge fan following on both sides of the border. When your name is linked to co-actors, how do you react? It''s irritating. I don''t understand all this talk about image. My biggest trip is my work, if I get that I''m happy. The entertainment industry is a unique space. There is a lot of dirt and muck. You have to live with that; it comes with the package. But your life should be like a swan''s. When you rise up, the dirt should fall away so that you can soar above it all, free and unblemished.', '| TNN | Updated: Apr 23, 2017, 11.26 AM IST', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/in-tollywood-directors-are-scared-to-take-too-many-risks-jaya-ahsan/articleshow/58324191.cms', 'Times of India'),

He is trying to accomplish this by cycling around the world and has covered Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Africa so far. However, what he originally planned was a medical career. He had been running his own hospital for over a decade. With time, he observed a steep rise in the number of people contracting chronic diseases at a relatively young age. "Earlier, I did not get many cases related to the heart, breathing and cancer. But over the last three to four years, I started receiving cases of 22 to 23 year old youths with heart disease and cancer. The number of people with asthma is also on the rise. So I decided to promote healthy living," he said. Dr Phaden swears by the benefits of cycling. "Even if you do cycling five times a week, for just half an hour, it reduces the chance of getting a heart attack by 30%," he said. Lately, his journey took him to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where he organised a number of seminars, camps and cycle rallies. "The reception I got there was overwhelming. They appreciate the fact that someone from outside has come to teach them about the environment. It feels nice to work with people who want to bring about a change," he said. Before setting out to cover the world, Dr Raj was amazed at the polarities he witnessed in different parts of the country. "Awareness levels are pathetic in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while Sikkim and Mizoram show a high degree of awareness and responsibility towards the environment.

"In this context coming together in BIMSTEC is truly important. We already saw earlier SAARC with all our high hopes has not done much, and for the moment it is doubtful whether or not the next summit meeting will happen," International Affairs Adviser Gowher Rizvi said at the opening of the BIMSTEC Network of Policy Think Tanks (BNPTT) meeting here at the Bay of Bengal grouping''s headquarters.

(48, 'Trucking on, despite obstacles', 'Vehicle company boss found there were challenges to be overcome when doing business in Kenya Armed with plenty of overseas experience and a market survey, Cheng Xiangliang, deputy general manager of AVIC JAC Motors (East Africa) Ltd, came to work in Kenya in October 2015. There were challenges ahead, however, particularly in dealing with clients face-to-face and in managing the company. "Before I came to Kenya, I had been working in the light-duty business vehicle department, overseeing the operations of agencies in Pakistan for two years, in Bangladesh for two years and assisting the overseeing of agencies in Sri Lanka for one year," Cheng says. "Although the above market assistant management has been done well, I want to foster my new ability of real business operation."   CHENG XIANGLIANG (second from right) and technicians from JAC headquarters pay a visit to a client (second from left) to learn about the conditions of their truck in September 2016. Provided to China Daily However, this did not stop him from drawing up a blueprint for the company, a joint venture between AVIC Intl Beijing and JAC Motors Group. The company was registered in Kenya in December 2014. It serves as an agent for JAC light-duty trucks in East Africa and deals with vehicle sales, post-sale service, component supplies and vehicle-related service. In 2015, the company sold 43 trucks in Kenya. As a newcomer to the market, it ranked a distant third after other Chinese truck makers. Statistics from the Kenya Revenue Authority show that sales of vehicles in Kenya grew by 30 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. In February 2016, the Kenyan government issued a new rule putting a fixed excise tax of 150,000 shillings ($1,454) on all kinds of imports of completed vehicles. Then, between June and July, the government issued a new rule replacing the tax with a 20 percent tax based on the CIF price of a complete vehicle in the 2016 fiscal year. The move brought down sales by more than 30 percent in 2016, with the contraction of infrastructure construction and rules that put a ceiling on the interest rate of bank loans. These changes created difficulties for the company, which imports vehicles into Kenya. "We are confident in the JAC commercial vehicle business in Kenya," says Cheng. "As a top three light duty truck player in the domestic market in China and No 2 Chinese light duty truck exporter, we will make efforts to give a boost in sales by targeting more Chinese consumers." This is partially because Chinese companies are more familiar with the JAC, which claims to be the second most popular light-duty vehicle in China. Major clients include engineering companies that need trucks for transporting tools and equipment and private companies that need to transport their products, according to Cheng. The company supplies various under-7-ton light-duty trucks and double cabin pickups. Meanwhile, it is looking for cooperation with plants to assemble the JAC in the country, which will avoid the complete build-up import''s high duty and lower the customer''s procurement cost. "The company hopes to profit from the 7-ton medium-duty truck that could enjoy a favorable market in Kenya this year," says Cheng, adding that the vehicle passed the tests last year and will make its debut this year. Based on market research, total sales of the truck are estimated at 2,700, out of a total of 12,000 commercial vehicles, including light, medium and heavy-duty trucks, pickups and buses, says Cheng. He is particularly proud of the company''s service team, which wins a great deal of praise from clients. One afternoon last April, the team got a call from the Pepsi Cola Logistics Co, saying one of its JAC light-duty truck had broken down on the way to a remote sales outlet. After receiving the call, the service team took tools and components and drove 70 kilometers to do the repair. It took the team three-and-a-half hours to reach the vehicle. After doing checks, they found the problem was due to the truck carrying too much weight, and to poor road conditions. The components they took did not fit, so they immediately sourced the proper parts from the warehouse and rented a motorcycle to rush them to the site in one-and-a-half-hours. The job was then completed in an hour. To make sure the truck was working properly, the team followed it to its destination, which it reached by midnight. Such dedication has won the trust of clients and given the company hope for booming business in the future, Cheng says. panzhongming@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 04/21/2017 page27)', 'By Pan Zhongming | China Daily Africa | Updated: 2017-04-23 15:47', 'http://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2017-04/23/content_29047532.htm', 'China Daily'),
(49, 'A few dollars more', 'Asia leads the world on wage growth and even China''s solid salary gains are not dulling its competitive edge With some of the cheapest labor in the world, wages in Asia are growing faster than anywhere else. Wage growth in emerging and developing G20 countries dropped to 2.5 percent in 2015, according to the International Labour Organization, but this year, in Asia Pacific, data provider ECA International expects real wage increases to hit 2.6 percent — higher than all other regions. Real wages are wages that have been adjusted for inflation over time. "Labor markets in Asia are fairly flexible, in the sense that government rules and regulations do not have a major impact. As a result, the wage increases that we see typically tend to be consistent with market developments and are economically sustainable," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, a Hong Kong-based consultancy. Some of the greatest gains in East Asia were visible in China, where average hourly manufacturing wages trebled to $3.60 between 2005 and 2016, according to consultancy Euromonitor International. Wages in China have been rising in tandem with the country''s breakneck growth. The average wage of the country''s manufacturing sector is now outstripping Brazil and Mexico and quickly catching up with weaker eurozone economies like Greece. "Minimum wages in China increased for different regions, and (the growth) has been constant since 2010, but at a different pace," said Daniel Kostzer, senior wage specialist for Asia Pacific with the ILO. "All the (minimum wages in Chinese) regions increased above 30 percent between 2010 and Dec 2016, but others, such as Jiangxi, almost doubled the nominal wage. Beijing had an increase in the nominal minimum wage of 63 percent in that period." The major municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as the provinces of Liaoning, Jiangsu, Hainan, Shandong and Hebei, all saw gains in monthly wages in 2016 of an average of 10.7 percent. This is a slower rate than previous years, which can be attributed to weaker economic growth, but it is far more than other economies. According to ECA International, the average real wage increase of 4.7 percent forecast for Chinese workers in 2017 is considerably higher than the global average forecast of 1.5 percent and the Asia-Pacific forecast of 2.6 percent. These high salary increases place China fourth in ECA''s "global real wage increase" rankings for 2017, up two places from the previous year. Shanghai remains the city with the highest minimum wage, with workers entitled to 2,190 yuan ($317) per month. Shenzhen (2,030 yuan), Guangzhou (1,895 yuan) and Beijing (1,890 yuan) round out the top four. "China''s wage growth remains solid, driven by a relatively favorable position of employees on the labor market due to continued demand for labor in China''s cities, demographic pressures and improved conditions in the countryside," said Kuijs from Oxford Economics. While this could mean that China will lose its competitive edge to emerging Southeast Asian countries, experts say otherwise. Kuijs noted that the impact of rising wages on the corporate sector varies across the spectrum. "Higher wages are leading to the movement of lower value-added manufacturing activity to other Asian countries with lower wages, such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh. "However, fairly rapid productivity increases and movement up the value chain means that in middle and higher value-added manufacturing activity, China is eating away market share of other countries." As a result, Kuijs said, the overall solid wage growth is not eroding the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. Some experts say that China''s wage increases are not as generous as previous years, mainly due to authorities trying to shift from an export and investment-led model to one more reliant on domestic consumption. Lee Quane, regional director for Asia with ECA International, said in a news release that "inflation-busting salary increases" offered by employers suggest that attracting and retaining staff is still a key challenge in China. Going forward, Chinese employees will see their salaries rise by an average of 7 percent in 2017, according to ECA''s latest Salary Trends survey. And Chinese consumers have the highest wage growth expectations in Asia, foreseeing real wage growth of 6.1 percent over the next six months, according to a new survey by Credit Suisse and Nielsen. In Asia Pacific, most countries boosted the minimum wage over the inflation rate, which remained fairly low in most of the region. South Korea recently increased its minimum wage to 6,470 won ($5.70) per hour for 2017, up 7.3 percent from last year. South Korea''s Ministry of Employment and Labor said the pay rise would affect an estimated 3.36 million workers. But the Federation of Korean Trade Unions had wanted a greater increase and said this raise would serve only to put more burden on smaller companies facing tough economic conditions. "We expected a double-figure pay rise, if not 10,000 won," said the federation last year. "The decision does not take into consideration those suffering due to a low income." In Japan, hourly wages for part-timers in the metropolitan areas surrounding Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya topped 1,000 yen ($9.05) for the first time last November. According to Japan''s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, part-time hourly wages came in 2.5 percent higher in January than a year earlier, outstripping growth in full-time workers'' pay. Moving away from East Asia, wages in parts of Southeast Asia also climbed. Minimum wages in Cambodia rose to the equivalent of $153 per month this year, up from $140 in 2016. Wages also increased in Vietnam, where monthly minimum pay is now 3.75 million dong ($165). Kostzer of the ILO said that with reduced demand for exports in developed countries, Asia-Pacific countries saw the minimum wage as a central policy tool for boosting domestic demand and compensating the negative effects of the slowdown in the rest of the world. "Looking at the changes in minimum wages in relation to changes of domestic prices, a proxy to the purchasing power of wages, the result is positive in all the countries." In terms of real wage increases in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore topped the charts in the ECA''s 2017 Asia-Pacific rankings. Kuijs said that in rapidly developing countries, pressures arise that are challenging for individual firms. "But, for the economy as a whole, the wage growth tends to be sustainable," he said. Southeast Asia has some of the cheapest labor, and is often seen as stealing China''s thunder as a manufacturing hub. Regional minimum salaries are in place in Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, and they may vary greatly between poorer provinces and capital cities. In some countries, only certain economic sectors have regularized minimum wages, such as the garment industry in Cambodia. Kostzer said increased interest in minimum wage policies has not been driven by a call for the "end of cheap labor" but by more calculated political concerns over social instability and rising inequality. That said, Cambodia agreed to raise the minimum monthly wage for textile workers this year to $153 — a hike of 9.3 percent. The country has around 700,000 workers in the garment industry. Kostzer said that strategies to keep wages low in order to attract investment are being replaced by ways to increase competitiveness. These include the improvement of human capital by investing in education and health, and improving infrastructure to make goods and services more accessible to markets. However, these initiatives are not enough to completely curb vulnerable employment as laid out in the recent ILO report, World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2017. "Entering 2017, working poverty (both extreme and moderate) is projected to continue to decline, in both rate and absolute number, while vulnerable employment numbers look set to rise, despite decreases in the vulnerable employment rate, largely as a result of population growth, especially in Southern Asia."', 'By HAKY MOON | China Daily | Updated: 2017-04-21 22:52', 'http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-04/21/content_29035384.htm', 'China Daily'),
(50, 'Admitting what we don''t know how to fix', 'What are the biggest problems facing humanity? A lack of education and opportunity, poverty, inequality, violence and war, and environmental degradation. These are the areas where trillions of dollars are spent in well-meaning efforts by governments and donors each year. But agreeing that a problem exists is not the same as knowing how to fix it. When it comes to development spending and philanthropy, it is too easy for money to be wasted - and opportunities missed - because this important distinction is ignored. We must, therefore, make some tough choices, including rolling back spending on some things that don''t work, investigating potential alternatives, and prioritizing interventions and policies that achieve the most. For a decade, the Copenhagen Consensus Center has conducted research into solutions to challenges at a national, regional and global level, which reveals areas where we often wrongly assume that we have all the answers. Lifting educational quality is incredibly important, and a huge number of donors pour money into achieving this around the world. There have been giant strides getting more children into school - but quality is often still appalling. What happens while they are in the classroom is just as important. The United Nations estimates one-third of all children currently in school - some 250 million kids - are failing to learn basic reading, writing or mathematic. There are other, often overlooked and indirect, ways to improve educational performance. Nutritional interventions may sound unrelated, but they ensure children receive the micronutrients they need and avoid worm infections, so they do better in school. A long-running nutrition experiment in Guatemala that started in 1969 saw pre-school children in several villages given a nutritionally enhanced diet and compared with similar children in neighboring communities, who got a less nutritionally useful diet. Thirty-five years later, when they were mature adults, there were startling differences. The well-nourished children who were not stunted by age three stayed in school longer and developed better cognitive skills as adults. They were more likely to be employed and earned higher wages; their better physical and mental development made them more suitable for both skilled manual and white-collar jobs. Other important concerns difficult to tackle include child marriage: obvious responses like outlawing it or telling people not to practice it rarely work in reality. And since most programs to reduce child marriage have not been subjected to high-quality research, more research is needed. However, indirect approaches can work. Getting more education to girls, improving opportunities for women to own businesses or inherit wealth are interventions that have helped. In southern Bangladesh, from 2008 to 2010, cooking oil was distributed to parents of girls between 15 and 17 years of age, conditional upon a monitor confirming the girls were still unmarried. Girls of recipient families were up to 30 percent less likely to marry before age 16. Each dollar spent achieved about $4 of social good. Another huge concern, where we know less than we might think, is poverty. Unconditional and conditional cash transfers, which basically mean giving cash or other assistance to the poor, are popular. But a new meta-analysis shows every dollar spent on these programs generates annual benefits worth just 28 cents. So far, we only have good evidence that these benefits last about three years, meaning the total benefit amounts to 84 cents for every dollar spent. This is a poor use of money. Even if we optimistically (and for now without evidence) assume that these benefits will continue unabated for 10 years, each dollar will generate less than $3 of good. Again, an indirect approach is demonstratively more effective. Increasing trade opportunities definitely reduces poverty. Completing the Doha Development Round of global free-trade talks would reduce the number of people in poverty by an astonishing 145 million in 15 years, according to research commissioned by Copenhagen Consensus. The world would be $11 trillion richer each year by 2030, with $7 trillion going to developing countries - equivalent to an extra $1,000 for every person every year in these countries by 2030. In development, just like in other areas of policy, we often tend to end up focusing on the most visible problems, forgetting that what we need are smart solutions. Areas like education and gender empowerment are far too important for us to accept that good intentions might be enough.

A seasoned lawyer in serving Belt and Road projects, Sean Prior, counsel at the law firm Mayer Brown JSM, is upbeat about the prospects of the initiative. "For the last few years, I have done a lot of work with Chinese developers and financiers in Asia, including Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines, and all my clients from those countries agree the Belt and Road is a huge opportunity," Prior said. Prior cited surging investment from China to the Belt and Road region and increasing cooperative agreements signed between Chinese and local companies. The initiative was proposed by China in 2013 to create a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient trade routes. Investment and trade have been growing rapidly for the past years. ASEAN countries, the Middle East and South Asia have attracted most of the investment, and the energy, transportation and information technology sectors appeared to be investors'' favorites, according to a report co-authored by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and China Bond Rating. Prior believes the initiative can generate benefits in a wide range of areas, with infrastructure improvements only the first stage of development. "Better infrastructure will create conditions for the moving of industrial production capacity from China to areas with resources and demand, and then there will be more projects in retail, real estate and other market-oriented sectors in countries with large populations," Prior said. The Belt and Road Initiative will have a broad influence in boosting local growth, according to Prior. Echoing his words, Dai Guanchun, a partner at the Jingtian and Gongcheng law firm, also expects the initiative to generate great opportunities. "It may be oil companies and project contractors at first, but investors in other sectors, from flour to finance, will be quickly attracted. The industrial chain will keep expanding," Dai said. "The local economy will boom and exchanges with the rest of the world will improve, which, in my perspective, is the true value of the Belt and Road Initiative." It is not just Chinese firms, but also those from developed countries, that can seek their fortunes in the process, according to Dai. China has invested more than $50 billion in countries along the Belt and Road routes since 2013. A total of 56 economic and trade cooperation zones have been built by Chinese businesses in 20 Belt and Road countries, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue and 180,000 jobs for relevant countries. However, experts also warned of risks due to an uncertain investment environment. Companies should be aware of the lack of legal protection for investors, uncertainties in local regulations, and protectionism in some countries, Dai said.

In addition to this, people in the southwestern region of the country have been experiencing saltier water due to frequent climatic impacts. But hopes are high for a new water treatment plant to serve nearly 2 million people in Bangladesh''s southwestern Khulna City, located about 180 km southwest of the capital Dhaka. China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), a subsidiary of China Communications Construction, has been setting up the mega surface water treatment plant in Khulna, one of the largest divisional cities in Bangladesh. Bangladesh''s cabinet committee approved CHEC''s bid to implement the first-of-a-kind $62.67 million project in 2015, the construction of which began in October last year. Under the project which spans 65 acres of land, two impounding reservoirs are also being constructed for preserving the treated water to supply to the city dwellers of Khulna. The reservoir will preserve about 775,200 cubic meters of water for the dry season. After implementation of the surface water treatment project, around 2 million people in Khulna and the surrounding areas will have a fresh drinking water supply to meet their daily demand. Officials say the plant, the third-largest in the country, will have the capacity to treat about 110 million liters of water every day. They said the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (KWASA) is now in a position to meet about 43 percent of the total demand. KWASA has been implementing the project with financial support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Asian Development Bank (ADP). Md. Imrul Hassan, a senior engineer who has been working as a JICA representative at the project site, told Xinhua recently that he has been supervising the quality of the work and looking into the progress of the work. "Up to now the progress of the project is nearly 50 percent complete. We are very happy with this progress right now. And the work is in full-swing. Hopefully we will end this project on time," Hassan said. He further added, "Our company is working here to expedite the progress while maintaining a high quality of work." "Right now the quality of the project and progress of this project is acceptable from a consultant''s point of view. We are really pleased." Hasan said that now Khulna WASA supplies 40 to 43 percent of total water demand. The source of the water is a deep tube well, but after this plant is ready nearly 80 percent of the total demand for water could be met from here to benefit the people." Masud Rana, project site engineer of China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., said 50 percent or more of the project work has already been completed. "After the project is implemented, people in this area especially the millions of Khulna city dwellers will be immensely benefited. Water will be brought to the plant for treatment from the Modhumati river (Bagherhat District near Khulna) and then purified water will be supplied from here for people to drink and other uses," he said.', 'Xinhua | Updated: 2017-04-05 16:58', 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2017-04/05/content_28805916.htm', 'China Daily'),
(56, 'Trucking on, despite obstacles', 'Vehicle company boss found there were challenges to be overcome when doing business in Kenya Armed with plenty of overseas experience and a market survey, Cheng Xiangliang, deputy general manager of AVIC JAC Motors (East Africa) Ltd, came to work in Kenya in October 2015. There were challenges ahead, however, particularly in dealing with clients face-to-face and in managing the company. "Before I came to Kenya, I had been working in the light-duty business vehicle department, overseeing the operations of agencies in Pakistan for two years, in Bangladesh for two years and assisting the overseeing of agencies in Sri Lanka for one year," Cheng says. "Although the above market assistant management has been done well, I want to foster my new ability of real business operation."   CHENG XIANGLIANG (second from right) and technicians from JAC headquarters pay a visit to a client (second from left) to learn about the conditions of their truck in September 2016. Provided to China Daily However, this did not stop him from drawing up a blueprint for the company, a joint venture between AVIC Intl Beijing and JAC Motors Group. The company was registered in Kenya in December 2014. It serves as an agent for JAC light-duty trucks in East Africa and deals with vehicle sales, post-sale service, component supplies and vehicle-related service. In 2015, the company sold 43 trucks in Kenya. As a newcomer to the market, it ranked a distant third after other Chinese truck makers. Statistics from the Kenya Revenue Authority show that sales of vehicles in Kenya grew by 30 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. In February 2016, the Kenyan government issued a new rule putting a fixed excise tax of 150,000 shillings ($1,454) on all kinds of imports of completed vehicles. Then, between June and July, the government issued a new rule replacing the tax with a 20 percent tax based on the CIF price of a complete vehicle in the 2016 fiscal year. The move brought down sales by more than 30 percent in 2016, with the contraction of infrastructure construction and rules that put a ceiling on the interest rate of bank loans. These changes created difficulties for the company, which imports vehicles into Kenya. "We are confident in the JAC commercial vehicle business in Kenya," says Cheng. "As a top three light duty truck player in the domestic market in China and No 2 Chinese light duty truck exporter, we will make efforts to give a boost in sales by targeting more Chinese consumers." This is partially because Chinese companies are more familiar with the JAC, which claims to be the second most popular light-duty vehicle in China. Major clients include engineering companies that need trucks for transporting tools and equipment and private companies that need to transport their products, according to Cheng. The company supplies various under-7-ton light-duty trucks and double cabin pickups. Meanwhile, it is looking for cooperation with plants to assemble the JAC in the country, which will avoid the complete build-up import''s high duty and lower the customer''s procurement cost. "The company hopes to profit from the 7-ton medium-duty truck that could enjoy a favorable market in Kenya this year," says Cheng, adding that the vehicle passed the tests last year and will make its debut this year. Based on market research, total sales of the truck are estimated at 2,700, out of a total of 12,000 commercial vehicles, including light, medium and heavy-duty trucks, pickups and buses, says Cheng. He is particularly proud of the company''s service team, which wins a great deal of praise from clients. One afternoon last April, the team got a call from the Pepsi Cola Logistics Co, saying one of its JAC light-duty truck had broken down on the way to a remote sales outlet. After receiving the call, the service team took tools and components and drove 70 kilometers to do the repair. It took the team three-and-a-half hours to reach the vehicle. After doing checks, they found the problem was due to the truck carrying too much weight, and to poor road conditions. The components they took did not fit, so they immediately sourced the proper parts from the warehouse and rented a motorcycle to rush them to the site in one-and-a-half-hours. The job was then completed in an hour. To make sure the truck was working properly, the team followed it to its destination, which it reached by midnight. Such dedication has won the trust of clients and given the company hope for booming business in the future, Cheng says. panzhongming@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 04/21/2017 page27)', 'By Pan Zhongming | China Daily Africa | Updated: 2017-04-23 15:47', 'http://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2017-04/23/content_29047532.htm', 'China Daily'),
(57, 'A few dollars more', 'Asia leads the world on wage growth and even China''s solid salary gains are not dulling its competitive edge With some of the cheapest labor in the world, wages in Asia are growing faster than anywhere else. Wage growth in emerging and developing G20 countries dropped to 2.5 percent in 2015, according to the International Labour Organization, but this year, in Asia Pacific, data provider ECA International expects real wage increases to hit 2.6 percent — higher than all other regions. Real wages are wages that have been adjusted for inflation over time. "Labor markets in Asia are fairly flexible, in the sense that government rules and regulations do not have a major impact. As a result, the wage increases that we see typically tend to be consistent with market developments and are economically sustainable," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, a Hong Kong-based consultancy. Some of the greatest gains in East Asia were visible in China, where average hourly manufacturing wages trebled to $3.60 between 2005 and 2016, according to consultancy Euromonitor International. Wages in China have been rising in tandem with the country''s breakneck growth. The average wage of the country''s manufacturing sector is now outstripping Brazil and Mexico and quickly catching up with weaker eurozone economies like Greece. "Minimum wages in China increased for different regions, and (the growth) has been constant since 2010, but at a different pace," said Daniel Kostzer, senior wage specialist for Asia Pacific with the ILO. "All the (minimum wages in Chinese) regions increased above 30 percent between 2010 and Dec 2016, but others, such as Jiangxi, almost doubled the nominal wage. Beijing had an increase in the nominal minimum wage of 63 percent in that period." The major municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as the provinces of Liaoning, Jiangsu, Hainan, Shandong and Hebei, all saw gains in monthly wages in 2016 of an average of 10.7 percent. This is a slower rate than previous years, which can be attributed to weaker economic growth, but it is far more than other economies. According to ECA International, the average real wage increase of 4.7 percent forecast for Chinese workers in 2017 is considerably higher than the global average forecast of 1.5 percent and the Asia-Pacific forecast of 2.6 percent. These high salary increases place China fourth in ECA''s "global real wage increase" rankings for 2017, up two places from the previous year. Shanghai remains the city with the highest minimum wage, with workers entitled to 2,190 yuan ($317) per month. Shenzhen (2,030 yuan), Guangzhou (1,895 yuan) and Beijing (1,890 yuan) round out the top four. "China''s wage growth remains solid, driven by a relatively favorable position of employees on the labor market due to continued demand for labor in China''s cities, demographic pressures and improved conditions in the countryside," said Kuijs from Oxford Economics. While this could mean that China will lose its competitive edge to emerging Southeast Asian countries, experts say otherwise. Kuijs noted that the impact of rising wages on the corporate sector varies across the spectrum. "Higher wages are leading to the movement of lower value-added manufacturing activity to other Asian countries with lower wages, such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh. "However, fairly rapid productivity increases and movement up the value chain means that in middle and higher value-added manufacturing activity, China is eating away market share of other countries." As a result, Kuijs said, the overall solid wage growth is not eroding the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. Some experts say that China''s wage increases are not as generous as previous years, mainly due to authorities trying to shift from an export and investment-led model to one more reliant on domestic consumption. Lee Quane, regional director for Asia with ECA International, said in a news release that "inflation-busting salary increases" offered by employers suggest that attracting and retaining staff is still a key challenge in China. Going forward, Chinese employees will see their salaries rise by an average of 7 percent in 2017, according to ECA''s latest Salary Trends survey. And Chinese consumers have the highest wage growth expectations in Asia, foreseeing real wage growth of 6.1 percent over the next six months, according to a new survey by Credit Suisse and Nielsen. In Asia Pacific, most countries boosted the minimum wage over the inflation rate, which remained fairly low in most of the region. South Korea recently increased its minimum wage to 6,470 won ($5.70) per hour for 2017, up 7.3 percent from last year. South Korea''s Ministry of Employment and Labor said the pay rise would affect an estimated 3.36 million workers. But the Federation of Korean Trade Unions had wanted a greater increase and said this raise would serve only to put more burden on smaller companies facing tough economic conditions. "We expected a double-figure pay rise, if not 10,000 won," said the federation last year. "The decision does not take into consideration those suffering due to a low income." In Japan, hourly wages for part-timers in the metropolitan areas surrounding Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya topped 1,000 yen ($9.05) for the first time last November. According to Japan''s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, part-time hourly wages came in 2.5 percent higher in January than a year earlier, outstripping growth in full-time workers'' pay. Moving away from East Asia, wages in parts of Southeast Asia also climbed. Minimum wages in Cambodia rose to the equivalent of $153 per month this year, up from $140 in 2016. Wages also increased in Vietnam, where monthly minimum pay is now 3.75 million dong ($165). Kostzer of the ILO said that with reduced demand for exports in developed countries, Asia-Pacific countries saw the minimum wage as a central policy tool for boosting domestic demand and compensating the negative effects of the slowdown in the rest of the world. "Looking at the changes in minimum wages in relation to changes of domestic prices, a proxy to the purchasing power of wages, the result is positive in all the countries." In terms of real wage increases in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore topped the charts in the ECA''s 2017 Asia-Pacific rankings. Kuijs said that in rapidly developing countries, pressures arise that are challenging for individual firms. "But, for the economy as a whole, the wage growth tends to be sustainable," he said. Southeast Asia has some of the cheapest labor, and is often seen as stealing China''s thunder as a manufacturing hub. Regional minimum salaries are in place in Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, and they may vary greatly between poorer provinces and capital cities. In some countries, only certain economic sectors have regularized minimum wages, such as the garment industry in Cambodia. Kostzer said increased interest in minimum wage policies has not been driven by a call for the "end of cheap labor" but by more calculated political concerns over social instability and rising inequality. That said, Cambodia agreed to raise the minimum monthly wage for textile workers this year to $153 — a hike of 9.3 percent. The country has around 700,000 workers in the garment industry. Kostzer said that strategies to keep wages low in order to attract investment are being replaced by ways to increase competitiveness. These include the improvement of human capital by investing in education and health, and improving infrastructure to make goods and services more accessible to markets. However, these initiatives are not enough to completely curb vulnerable employment as laid out in the recent ILO report, World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2017.

Even if we optimistically (and for now without evidence) assume that these benefits will continue unabated for 10 years, each dollar will generate less than $3 of good. Again, an indirect approach is demonstratively more effective. Increasing trade opportunities definitely reduces poverty. Completing the Doha Development Round of global free-trade talks would reduce the number of people in poverty by an astonishing 145 million in 15 years, according to research commissioned by Copenhagen Consensus. The world would be $11 trillion richer each year by 2030, with $7 trillion going to developing countries - equivalent to an extra $1,000 for every person every year in these countries by 2030. In development, just like in other areas of policy, we often tend to end up focusing on the most visible problems, forgetting that what we need are smart solutions. Areas like education and gender empowerment are far too important for us to accept that good intentions might be enough.

(62, 'Belt and Road ''huge opportunity'' for China, world: Experts', 'BEIJING - Experts said the China-backed Belt and Road Initiative will create fresh business opportunities for the world, as well as tangible benefits. A seasoned lawyer in serving Belt and Road projects, Sean Prior, counsel at the law firm Mayer Brown JSM, is upbeat about the prospects of the initiative. "For the last few years, I have done a lot of work with Chinese developers and financiers in Asia, including Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines, and all my clients from those countries agree the Belt and Road is a huge opportunity," Prior said. Prior cited surging investment from China to the Belt and Road region and increasing cooperative agreements signed between Chinese and local companies. The initiative was proposed by China in 2013 to create a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient trade routes. Investment and trade have been growing rapidly for the past years. ASEAN countries, the Middle East and South Asia have attracted most of the investment, and the energy, transportation and information technology sectors appeared to be investors'' favorites, according to a report co-authored by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and China Bond Rating. Prior believes the initiative can generate benefits in a wide range of areas, with infrastructure improvements only the first stage of development. "Better infrastructure will create conditions for the moving of industrial production capacity from China to areas with resources and demand, and then there will be more projects in retail, real estate and other market-oriented sectors in countries with large populations," Prior said. The Belt and Road Initiative will have a broad influence in boosting local growth, according to Prior. Echoing his words, Dai Guanchun, a partner at the Jingtian and Gongcheng law firm, also expects the initiative to generate great opportunities. "It may be oil companies and project contractors at first, but investors in other sectors, from flour to finance, will be quickly attracted. The industrial chain will keep expanding," Dai said. "The local economy will boom and exchanges with the rest of the world will improve, which, in my perspective, is the true value of the Belt and Road Initiative." It is not just Chinese firms, but also those from developed countries, that can seek their fortunes in the process, according to Dai. China has invested more than $50 billion in countries along the Belt and Road routes since 2013. A total of 56 economic and trade cooperation zones have been built by Chinese businesses in 20 Belt and Road countries, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue and 180,000 jobs for relevant countries. However, experts also warned of risks due to an uncertain investment environment. Companies should be aware of the lack of legal protection for investors, uncertainties in local regulations, and protectionism in some countries, Dai said. The CASS report cited ethnic and religious factors, a changing geopolitical landscape, as well as weak and unbalanced global economic growth as major challenges.', 'Xinhua | Updated: 2017-04-12 17:19', 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-04/12/content_28898671.htm', 'China Daily'),

In addition to this, people in the southwestern region of the country have been experiencing saltier water due to frequent climatic impacts. But hopes are high for a new water treatment plant to serve nearly 2 million people in Bangladesh''s southwestern Khulna City, located about 180 km southwest of the capital Dhaka. China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), a subsidiary of China Communications Construction, has been setting up the mega surface water treatment plant in Khulna, one of the largest divisional cities in Bangladesh. Bangladesh''s cabinet committee approved CHEC''s bid to implement the first-of-a-kind $62.67 million project in 2015, the construction of which began in October last year. Under the project which spans 65 acres of land, two impounding reservoirs are also being constructed for preserving the treated water to supply to the city dwellers of Khulna. The reservoir will preserve about 775,200 cubic meters of water for the dry season. After implementation of the surface water treatment project, around 2 million people in Khulna and the surrounding areas will have a fresh drinking water supply to meet their daily demand. Officials say the plant, the third-largest in the country, will have the capacity to treat about 110 million liters of water every day. They said the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (KWASA) is now in a position to meet about 43 percent of the total demand. KWASA has been implementing the project with financial support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Asian Development Bank (ADP). Md. Imrul Hassan, a senior engineer who has been working as a JICA representative at the project site, told Xinhua recently that he has been supervising the quality of the work and looking into the progress of the work. "Up to now the progress of the project is nearly 50 percent complete. We are very happy with this progress right now. And the work is in full-swing. Hopefully we will end this project on time," Hassan said. He further added, "Our company is working here to expedite the progress while maintaining a high quality of work." "Right now the quality of the project and progress of this project is acceptable from a consultant''s point of view. We are really pleased." Hasan said that now Khulna WASA supplies 40 to 43 percent of total water demand. The source of the water is a deep tube well, but after this plant is ready nearly 80 percent of the total demand for water could be met from here to benefit the people." Masud Rana, project site engineer of China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., said 50 percent or more of the project work has already been completed. "After the project is implemented, people in this area especially the millions of Khulna city dwellers will be immensely benefited. Water will be brought to the plant for treatment from the Modhumati river (Bagherhat District near Khulna) and then purified water will be supplied from here for people to drink and other uses," he said.', 'Xinhua | Updated: 2017-04-05 16:58', 'http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2017-04/05/content_28805916.htm', 'China Daily'),

For tourists in this picturesque region nestled on the Bay of Bengal, not having a camera or a smartphone and selfie-stick is not a problem.

Saju also opted for a local photographer because he suggested different angles for better looking photos. "I''m on vacation with my family and there are so many great photo opportunities to capture our wonderful memories," Saju said, adding that the local photographers provide a very decent service. Photographer Abdullah, who has been offering his services at the Cox''s Bazar beach for the last 12 years, said he tries his best to win customers'' hearts by offering a fast, high-quality and professional service. "More tourists means more money for us," said the photographer, who has practiced photography since the era of analog cameras. "The beach authorities have given me, like all recognized photographers, a uniform. More and more guests are visiting the beach and we try our best to win their hearts with great photographs." Another photographer, Polash, has been involved with the profession since 2001. He said that in the past Cox''s Bazaar had not been particularly developed, but that these days there is very good beach administration, better security and more facilities. "The beach is very safe now. Tourists are coming and visiting places in Cox''s Bazar without any trouble. "When we used to shoot on film we charged 20 taka ($0.25) for one printed photo. Now we provide photos on memory cards and also charge 20 taka for one printed photo," Polash said. Taking photos for customers on the beach has also created an earning opportunity for Md Babul, a student, who works on the beach snapping photos during his free time. "I need to earn money for my family. The district administration has fixed the prices of photos so for each digital photo we charge 5 taka. But for each printed photo a customer needs to pay 20 taka," he said. Photographer Dildar said he spent 40,000 taka to buy a camera and lens to set up his beachfront photography operation. "I earn about 10,000-12,000 taka every month. The more people come, the more I earn," he said.   A couple pose for photographs in the Bay of Bengal at Cox''s Bazar beach, Bangladesh.Pavel Rahman / Associated Press (China Daily USA 03/30/2017 page10)', 'By Xinhua | China Daily USA | Updated: 2017-03-30 07:31', 'http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-03/30/content_28739736.htm', 'China Daily'),

Jose Vinals, chairman of the London-based international banking and financial services company, says that China is a critical market for the bank, as the country and the northern Asian region contribute about 40 percent to the group''s total income. Vinals expressed optimism about long-term economic prospects in China, which remains a strategically important and a top-priority market for the company as it pushes through with its transformation through the cleanup of bad assets, cost reductions and strengthened risk discipline. The group posted a pre-tax profit of $409 million last year, turning around from a loss of $1.5 billion a year earlier. Vinals says his bank will continue to bet on the further opening-up of the Chinese financial system, the greater role of the renminbi in global markets, and domestic structural reforms with emphasis on quality and efficiency. "I am very positive on the Chinese economy, and aiming at around a 6.5 percent growth target for 2017 is very wise," Vinals told China Daily in an interview on the sidelines of the China Development Forum. Vinals says the financial risks in China are manageable and need to be continuously managed, adding that it is important for the country to reduce the pace of leveraging and ensure that its corporate sector, especially state-owned enterprises, is reformed. "The important thing is to support growth of the right policy mix, and the right structural reforms, and also try to diminish excessive growth of credit, particularly credit growth from the shadow banking system, which is the big source of risk," he says. In the meantime, the bank is actively seeking opportunities to partner with the Chinese government and companies along the Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, Standard Chartered participated in 40 deals related to the initiative and supported the Chinese government to help develop water power plants in Pakistan and Bangladesh. "This is the most important single initiative that exists to support globalization, and it is fostering cross-border integration in terms of infrastructure, cross-border investment and international trade," he says. lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 03/24/2017 page29)', 'By Li Xiang | China Daily Europe | Updated: 2017-03-24 07:36', 'http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-03/24/content_28659957.htm', 'China Daily'),
(68, 'Trade show: Labor costs still factor', 'Although labor costs in China have been rising, and some Chinese textile companies have set up operations in the US, manufacturers are more likely to look elsewhere in Asia to maintain their margins. Arnold Zimberg, the co-founder of the menswear trade show Boulevard Prêt-à-Sale at New York''s Javits Center organized by Messe Frankfurt, is an industry veteran who has worked with brands like Givenchy and Emilio Pucci. He said that though there may be a few Chinese textile companies that are bringing some operations to the US, he has "no idea how they''re going to do this" in a sustainable way. "They''re still working with American labels, and you still have the wage differences - how are they going to compete?" he said. "Are you telling me that [Chinese clothing manufacturer] TAL is going to start making shirts in North Carolina and compete with their production in China? I''ve been doing this 44 years - never, because it''s not feasible!" "We don''t see the US as being an opportunity for manufacturing," said Bennett Fruchter, vice-president of product development at Shanghai Shenda America (SSA), a US subsidiary under parent company Shangtex, one of the largest clothing manufacturers in China. "Prices are increasing in China, [so] we have been for the past year looking at alternate countries for manufacturing. We do recognize the need for diversification for sourcing in our supply chain, so we''ve looked at Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and those are some of the countries that we''ve been looking at," he said. But he doesn''t see doing business in the US as a "short-term goal that could be something we would explore in the future". SSA began operating in the US about a decade ago and sources, manufactures and delivers clothing primarily for US clients, including American Eagle, Shop NBC, and warehouse club Costco, which sells clothing under its in-house label Kirkland. "We''re looking at different acquisition options, so that''s not something we would rule out, but based on the current price compression we''re feeling in the market, we believe that we still need to be offshore on most of our programs, or all of our programs," said Fruchter, who spoke to China Daily on Tuesday. China''s Keer Group opened a $218 million textile factory in South Carolina in 2015 due to increasing costs of textile production in China and ever-more competitive labor costs in the US, particularly in counties in the US South once known for manufacturing. Jules Weinsieder, president of Creative Production Resources, said that while manufacturing costs in China are going up, the more direct impact is that manufacturing in China will focus on high-end goods and specialty apparel. He said Chinese investors would be interested in buying existing US operations and running them, but US workers can''t compete on garment quality. "The only thing the US can compete with is very simple garments like T-shirts, dresses, pants", but beyond that, China and other markets like Vietnam and Bangladesh have the market cornered, he said. amyhe@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily USA 03/23/2017 page2)', 'By Amy He in New York | China Daily USA | Updated: 2017-03-23 11:34', 'http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2017-03/23/content_28652820.htm', 'China Daily'),

That''s on top of the $1.45 million already pumped into the 53 countries and regions along the Belt and Road by China in 2016. Private companies from different fields around the country shared their investment experiences in Belt and Road countries at the conference. Conducting in-depth due diligence, especially with the assistance of professional third party institutions, is critical in preventing investment risks, said Nan Cunhui, chairman of Chint Group, a company focusing on industrial electrical equipment production and clean energy fields. Localizing the operation, including purchasing local plants, recruiting local employees and cooperating with enterprises in destination countries are all effective measures to avoid trade barriers and increase competencies. Resource integration can also push forward supply-side reform at home, added the chairman. Most Belt and Road countries have under-developed agriculture production, and they not only demand goods and technologies from China, but also integrated solutions. As Lin Yinsun, chairman of agricultural company Zhengbang Group said, the company promoted an "enterprise + farmer" mode and transferred local family workshops to factories in Angola, Egypt, and Bangladesh, and earned support from the tribe chief to the Agriculture Secretary in these countries. Industry and commerce federations nationwide also play a key part in assisting smooth and effective exploration of private companies in Belt and Road countries. Lei Yuanjiang, chairman of the Industry and Commerce Federation in East China''s Jiangxi province, said they compiled Belt and Road documents for its member enterprises, and established a Belt and Road service center in October 2015. The Federation formed an alliance in December 2016 to manage enterprise behavior and prevent vicious competition in overseas countries, which has attracted 126 member companies to date. The Federation also established connections with 54 federations in Belt and Road countries and regions and signed cooperation agreements with 22 of them. According to Zheng Yuewen, chairman of the China International Chamber of Commerce for the Private Sector, the Chamber has completed signing MOUs with federations in Belt and Road countries, and plans to bring together leaders of chambers in Belt and Road countries for an annual summit starting this year.

The pilot couldn''t control it," said Youngule, who is also Deputy Director of Air Traffic Services. "I saw it until the very last moment before the fire engulfed the aircraft." When the plane crashed, its door flew open, which allowed the pilot and rescue crews to get everybody out, he said. Those with injuries were taken to Wau''s hospital for treatment, said Youngule. The plane, an Antonov 26, carried 44 passengers and had five crew members, said Youngule. On social media, images appeared of the plane with smoke billowing from the wrecked fuselage. UN peacekeepers worked with local emergency workers to evacuate passengers from the plane, according to David Shearer, head of the UN mission in South Sudan. Peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Nepal and China helped in the emergency work, he said. The plane was from South Supreme Airlines, a South Sudanese carrier. It was making a trip from Juba to Wau, in northwestern South Sudan when it crashed. Most of the passengers were South Sudanese with two foreigners, one each from China and Eritrea.
